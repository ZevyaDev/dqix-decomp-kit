# Each gate() is a ~6 min full-ROM ninja check. A single reloc-false-match (byte-exact but calling the
# WRONG address — invisible to the masked per-func compare) makes the whole-wave gate RED, and isolating
# it costs O(k log N) gates, so MAXGATES fires and the ENTIRE wave defers with 0 commits. That loop was
# burning every wave on the drained overlays. Fix: classify locally FIRST (~0.3s/func, no gate), then
# gate only the fully-verified TRUSTED set — which is green on the first build and commits in one shot.
# BAD verdicts never reach a gate at all; RISKY (unconfirmable reloc) is quarantined to its own bisect.

# exact-size + no-undef), so a whole-wave gate is green on the FIRST try in the normal case (universal

# mangling) are FIXED. CH = all: ~7 rebuilds -> 1. If a red ever recurses deep, that's the rare cost.
# TWO-STAGE GATE. Stage 1: the TRUSTED set as ONE build. Every one of these is byte-exact AND has each
# reloc target independently confirmed against the pristine binary, so nothing in it can be a
# reloc-false-match — it is green on the first gate and commits the whole set for the cost of one build.
# Stage 2: RISKY (some reloc unconfirmable) bisects under the gate cap, isolated so it can never drag
# the TRUSTED set down with it. Previously both were gated together, so one bad func cost the whole wave.
# TRUSTED funcs are byte-exact with every reloc target confirmed, so a red gate on one CANNOT be a

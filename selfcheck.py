"""Assert the pipeline invariants whose breakage silently discards finished work.

Every check here corresponds to a fault that actually happened and cost matches:
the tools looked healthy, waves ran green, and correct sources were parked or
rewritten wrongly with no diagnostic. They are cheap and static, so run them
each cycle -- a regression should be loud, not something found by hand weeks
later.

Exit status is non-zero if any invariant fails, so run_all can surface it.

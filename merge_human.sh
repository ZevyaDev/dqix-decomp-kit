# Merge human-written decomp into ours. Run --check first in every session.
#
# SCOPE, and it is narrow on purpose: the OPEN PULL REQUESTS against
# DQIX/dqix-decomp, plus any single ref the user names explicitly. Nothing else.
#
# An earlier version of this script enumerated a hard-coded list of contributor
# branches. That is how eakeys/zone3d -- work its author had not proposed for
# merge and had not finished -- got merged uninstructed, then reverted. A branch
# that is not an open PR is not an invitation; if the user wants one, they will
# name it (that is how eakeys/file_loading came in). So this script discovers
# candidates from the PR list and from nowhere else.
#
# The clone was SHALLOW (root == upstream/main's tip), which made git report NO
# common ancestor with any contributor branch and a 12,328-file diff. `git fetch
# --unshallow` fixed that permanently; if "refusing to merge unrelated
# histories" ever returns, that is the cause.
#
# The repair passes are NOT optional polish -- a raw `git merge` of a substantial
# branch does not compile, does not link, and does not checksum:
#
#   union_merge.py      delinks.txt/symbols.txt are keyed records, not prose
#   fix_includes.py     a branch may move headers (System/ -> Util/Random.h)
#   rename_symbols.py   renames break at COMPILE time, before the linker runs
#   relink_undefined.py callers on both sides name functions the other renamed
#   merge_fixups.sh     the few sites no address lookup can bridge
#
# The relink pass must LOOP: each round exposes references masked by the previous
# round's errors.
#
# tools/configure.py carries two deltas upstream does not have, BOTH inside
# add_mwcc_builds, which is also where upstream edits land -- so every upstream
# merge conflicts there and resolving in theirs' favour silently drops one:
#   * the get_asm_files loop that emits mwasm builds for .s sources
#   * the CC_OVERRIDES / $cc_exe per-file compiler override
# Keep both sides of that hunk. selfcheck.py asserts they are still present.
#
# Usage:
#   bash merge_human.sh --check      list open PRs and whether we already have them
#   bash merge_human.sh <number>     merge that PR's head
#   bash merge_human.sh <ref>        merge a ref the user named explicitly

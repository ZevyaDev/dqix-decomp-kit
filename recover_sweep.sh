# ZERO-TOKEN RECOVERY SWEEP. Re-integrates matched worker source that is sitting on disk but is NOT
# in the build, for every module that has any.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. hold_<mod>/ , <mod>_stage/ and quarantine/ accumulate every .cpp a worker ever
# produced. A wave defers work for reasons that are NOT "the match is wrong" — gate-cap, link-layout
# drift from a neighbour, a transient git index.lock (that one alone deferred 42 green functions in
# ov001 wave 2; re-gating them later committed 41/42 on the first try). Those files were only ever
# reconsidered when run_all happened to route back to that same module — but a module that defers its
# wave scores low yield and goes ON COOLDOWN, so the module holding the most recoverable work is the
# one least likely to be revisited. Measured at 68.75%: 419+ functions already matched, byte-exact,
# on disk, invisible to the build. This sweep lands them for zero worker tokens.
#
# Serial by construction — ov_recover mutates config/ and gates a full `ninja check`; two at once
# corrupt each other. Usage: bash recover_sweep.sh

# HARVEST THE SCRATCHPAD FIRST. Workers iterate in SCRATCH/w<addr>.cpp and only copy the file into
# src/ once it matches — so a worker killed BETWEEN achieving the match and copying leaves a real,
# gate-verified match where nothing looks for it. Measured: 78 addrs a worker declared PASS on are
# not in the build, 67 of them with a candidate still sitting in scratch; a full gate pass found 38
# that match TODAY. This stages them into hold_* so the sweep below commits them.

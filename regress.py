"""REGRESSION tests for the helper scripts, pinning behaviour that was fixed by hand.

    python regress.py

pipetest.py tests the GATE against the ROM. This tests the scripts AROUND it -- the ranking, the
prompt, the verdict parsing, the placement filter, the colour sweep -- because those were edited
repeatedly on 08-20 with nothing but selfcheck's static invariants as a guard, and selfcheck cannot
see behaviour. Every case below encodes a fault that actually happened and cost something, so a
failure here means a real regression, not a style drift.

Each test states the fault it detects. If you change a script and a test fails, the question is
which of the two is wrong -- do not delete the test to make the suite green.

"""IDENTIFY unmatched functions against reference DS decompilations. Research first, never asm-first.

    python sdkident.py index              build the reference index from everything under refs/
    python sdkident.py match <mod> <addr> what in the references implements this function
    python sdkident.py sweep [mod]        every unmatched function, ranked by identifiability
    python sdkident.py show <proj/file> <name>   print a reference implementation

WHY. Library code -- the BIOS syscall stubs, the Metrowerks C runtime, NitroSDK -- is the same
source in every DS game, and several projects have already matched it. Porting a human
implementation beats decompiling it ourselves on every axis: no worker tokens, real names and
types, and code a person wrote. Our `_fadd` is instruction-for-instruction pokediamond's `_fadd`.

IDENTIFICATION IS BY INSTRUCTION SHAPE, NOT BY NAME. Names are a weak signal: ours are descriptive
(`VectorizedMemset`) where the SDK's are official (`MI_CpuFill8`), and 973 of our 1101 unmatched
functions have no name at all. The mnemonic sequence is the actual fingerprint, so a match is a
measured claim -- "these 135 instructions agree" -- rather than a guess from a similar spelling.

THERE IS NO ASM FALLBACK, DELIBERATELY. A sweep that transcribes our own bytes into an `asm` block
whenever C is hard produces assembly where none was needed: the last one matched a game function
and `WaitForVCountZero`, which was four bytes from a clean C match. Assembly here is a CONCLUSION
drawn from a reference decomp that independently implements the same routine as assembly -- and
even then C is preferred if the reference has C. Anything unidentified is reported as
NEEDS-RESEARCH and goes back to normal decompilation. This tool never writes an `asm` block.

ADDRESS BANDS ARE A HINT, NOT A FILTER. Library code clusters at the bottom and top of arm9, so
`sweep` reports that grouping -- but a hardcoded band is a guess about a boundary nobody verified,
so nothing is excluded on that basis and the whole module is always searched.

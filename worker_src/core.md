## NEVER WRITE SOURCE WITH A SHELL HEREDOC — USE Write/Edit
`cat > f.cpp <<'EOF' ... EOF` breaks on quoting that is ordinary in C++: nested `'` and `"`,
backslash escapes, `$` inside a string. The failure is a truncated or missing file plus a misleading
`unexpected EOF while looking for matching`. Shell redirection is fine only for a one-liner like
`echo ok > flag.txt`.

## YOUR FUNCTION GOES IN THE `wip/` DIR YOUR PROMPT NAMES — NEVER IN `src/`
The build globs every `.cpp` under `src/`, so an in-progress file there — a `goto` whose label you
have not typed yet — fails `ninja check` for EVERY module and every other worker, and an integration
running in that module will delete, quarantine or commit your half-finished file. `wgate` compiles
whatever path you give it, so nothing needs your file in the repo until it MATCHES; the pipeline
moves it in for you then. Read siblings in `src/` freely — that is the cheapest lever there is — but
write only to `$SP/wip/<module>/`.

## SCRATCH GOES IN `$SP/handwork/`, NEVER IN `$SP` ITSELF
Probe scripts, variant generators and disassembly dumps written into the `dqix-sp` root fail the
pipeline's own inventory check on every run and have to be swept by hand. Put them in
`$SP/handwork/` — nothing there is read by another tool, and it survives the session.

## WRITE THE SOURCE, NOT A TRANSLATION OF THE LISTING
Read the listing for its structure: which blocks are `if`/`else`, which back-edges are loops, which
loads are fields of one object, which `bl`s are calls with real arguments. Then write that C++: typed
parameters and a struct for each object, named locals, `if`/`while`/`for`, compound assignment. Never
name a variable after a register (`r0`, `r4`), never copy a flag into a local (`cc = r0 - 0`), never
label a block by its address (`L1c:`); `plausible.py` refuses all three as TRANSLITERATED. Match the
structure first, then fix codegen differences with the levers below, never by going back to
one statement per instruction. The forms under NATURAL FORMS THAT MATCH WHERE A TRICK DID come first.

## NAMES ARE PLAIN — NEVER INVENT ONE
Every name you write is plain: functions `func_<addr>` (a helper with no symbol `inline_<lowest caller
addr>`), globals `data_<addr>`, types `Struct_<addr>` (the address of its global instance, else of the
first function using it), enums `Enum_<addr>` with constants `Enum_<addr>_<value>`, members
`unknown_<hexoff>_` (bitfields `unknown_<off>_<bit>_`), parameters `arg0..`, locals `var0..`. Only
names already on upstream main stay. Landing renames anything else (`plainnames.py fix`) and
`prready.py` refuses it as NOT A PLAIN NAME.

## THE GATE NAMES YOUR RESIDUE — ROUTE ON THAT CLASS, NOT ON A GUESS
Every `wgate` run ends with `RESIDUE <CLASS> <metric> <detail>`. Route on it:

| class | what it means | do this |
|---|---|---|
| `NO-COMPILE` | it does not build | read the first error only; a second prototype of a function the headers already declare is the usual one (`0216806c`, `02168354`) |
| `OVERGEN` / `UNDERGEN` | wrong length | no colouring rewrite can help while the size is wrong — fix the shape first |
| `LOOP-SHAPE` | branch targets differ | a loop/guard is built differently. Declaration order is INERT here |
| `REGPERM` | only register numbers differ | `colorsweep --apply`, then recipe #9 (callee-saved) or #15 (scratch) |
| `SCHED` | same instructions, different order | move the DEFINITION, do not renumber. `colorsweep --apply` generates these. A store and a `mov` swapped near a spilled parameter: narrow that parameter's type (`int` -> `unsigned char`/`short`, TYPE WIDTH IS A REGALLOC LEVER, `021df924`) |
| `OPERAND` | same mnemonics, different immediates/offsets | check offsets and constants (#4) |
| `SHAPE` | mnemonics differ | the C construct is wrong. Do NOT permute declarations |

`wgate` also prints a `GATE` line with your best result and how many gates since it improved, and a
`STOP` directive when it stops moving. STOP is the decision — write your verdict and end. Never
stop before one while the gate is still improving.

**WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED OUT ON YOUR ADDRESS** is injected below under its own heading
when there is any, straight from `worker_src/deadends.md`. If the section is absent, nothing
has been ruled out yet. Never edit that file or anything else in the kit checkout: write what
you disproved into the handoff section of the doc this prompt named.

**INSTRUCTIONS mwcc WILL NOT EMIT FROM ANY C.** Not a residue to permute — if the target needs one of
these, the function is `.s` work or not ours. Each was driven to exhaustion against the real gate.

* `ldm`/`stm` over more than four registers. Block copy is hardcoded to `{r0-r3}` with writeback on
  both sides at every optimisation level; explicit word loads stay plain `ldr`/`str`, and `memcpy` is
  a real `bl`.
* A register in an `ldm`/`stm` list that block copy never uses — `r8`, `ip`.
* `ip` in a `push`/`pop` callee-save list.
* An `stmia` in THUMB. Consecutive ascending register stores to consecutive addresses stay unfused at
  every level.
* An un-predicated early exit. A conditional return folds to `bxeq lr`; the ROM's
  `beq <own bx lr>` / `b` / `bx lr` triple cannot be reached, and `optimize_for_size off` does not
  change it.
* A branch INTO another function's interior, at an address no symbol names.

**Those are exhausted FORMS, not a verdict on the function.** The list above says "stop permuting the
expression", not "this cannot match" — that claim has been wrong every time it was made here.
`ov015:0218ee38` was called a scheduling wall and then closed in three steps; `main:02079cf8` was
parked at SHAPE 22 and a later session took it to REGPERM 3. When the expression space is spent,
move UP a level — these are the angles that have NOT been tried on any of them:

- **Your callee signatures.** 31 of 119 kept artifacts declare a callee with the wrong parameter
  list, and a wrong signature changes argument setup and live ranges — which is exactly what a
  register residue looks like. Run `python $KIT/symfix.py <your.cpp>` and re-gate BEFORE concluding
  anything about colouring.
  `0218ecd8` — a `sub r3, sp, #4` / `stm` / `ldr r3, [r3]` block in the target is the tell that a
  struct argument STRADDLES r3 and the stack. Size the parameter to produce it: two 12-byte structs
  by value put the second across r3/[sp]/[sp+4]. Do not copy a sibling's parameter list on faith.
- **Compiler FLAGS — this one is PROVEN, try it early.** The build could always swap the mwccarm
  build per file but never the flags, so every residue in this project was measured on one flag set.
  32 parked addresses improve under a non-default set. Cost: seconds. `main:020b7ba0` is the worked
  example both ways: REGPERM 14 on the default, byte-exact under `-O4`, and then MATCHED at the
  default once the flag had shown which redundancy to remove.

      WGATE_FLAGS="-O4" python $KIT/wgate.py <mod> <addr> <your.cpp>     # also -O3, -opt speed
      python $KIT/flagsweep.py --only <addr>                            # sweeps the useful sets

  A flag match is a DIAGNOSIS, never a result: the ROM was built at one flag set (-O2 globally), so
  matching only under -O4 means YOUR source carries something -O4 deletes — a redundant local, a
  dead store, a cached value the original re-read. Locate the difference with the flag, then fix the
  C and match at -O2. Never land it behind an override; `wlog/flag_leads.txt` records these and the
  sweep deliberately does not stage them.
- **Definition ORDER, enumerated rather than reasoned about.** When a run of field reads feeds
  arithmetic and the residue is registers, the order those values are DEFINED is the whole answer,
  and the space is bounded — `020b7ba0`'s was the 47th of 720:

      python $KIT/pad/permorder.py <mod> <addr> <src.cpp> <marker.txt>

- **The values around the residue, not in it.** A register pair that will not swap is often decided
  by a live range that starts somewhere else — a value the ROM re-loads and you cache, or one you
  re-load and it caches. Look for the DEFINITION that owns the register, not the use.

Write what you ruled out into the handoff section of the doc this prompt named, then take the next
address.

## NEVER WRITE HAND ASSEMBLY. STOP INSTEAD.
`asm { ... }` reaches the bytes by definition, so it is not a match — it is the question restated.
The point of this project is C source, and a hand-asm candidate is refused at integration: the
integrator moves it to `asm_park_<module>/`, drops it from the trusted set, and serves the address to
another worker, so the money you spent produced nothing. Measured 2026-08-25: `020c19b8` gated MATCH
as `asm`, cost $1.52, and was parked minutes later.

If you cannot reach the bytes with C, write `BLOCKED <addr> <CLASS> <metric> <your best file>` and
stop. A cheap honest BLOCKED is worth more than an asm file: the next session reads it
and starts past your dead ends. The only addresses allowed to land as assembly are the handful in
`asm_allow.txt` (BIOS syscall stubs and NitroSDK routines the SDK itself ships as asm), and you are
not the one who decides an address belongs there.

## STATEMENT ORDER IS THE SCHEDULE (promoted from opus matches, 2026-08-20)
When the diff is register numbers, load order, or an instruction sitting a few slots early/late, the
lever is almost never a different expression -- it is the ORDER of the statements that feed it. Four
280-byte functions closed on exactly this after colorsweep had already failed:

- `ov002:02168d54` — a field loaded into a callee-saved register BEFORE a call whose result is another
  argument of the same call (`ldr r4, [r2, #0x3cc] ; bl … ; and r2, r4, #0xff`) needs BOTH locals:
  `int v = field; int r = Get(); f(x, (signed char)r, (unsigned char)v);`. With only `v`, or with
  everything inline, mwcc moves the load after the call.
- `func_0205dd08` — the order of four setup assignments IS the emitted ldr/ldrsh order. Reordering
  the assignments reordered the loads; no expression changed.
- `func_021c3fb4` — moving a plain store (`evt.tag = 2;`) BEFORE an adjacent bitfield store changed
  which register held the value.
- `021e5a6c` — the same arithmetic on two fields emits in PHASE order, not field order. Write it as
  three passes over both fields (both divides, then both multiplies, then both fixups) rather than
  one nested expression per field; finishing field y before starting z reorders the whole block.
- `func_020b33f0` — declare the group pointer and index up front, then assign `index = 0` AFTER the
  pointer. Declaration order and assignment order are separate levers; this needed both.
- `func_0204bc74` — build a value by reassigning the PARAMETER in place (`val &= 0xfff; val |= pal;`)
  rather than composing a new local, so the OR lands in the parameter's register.

So: before concluding regalloc is inert, permute the order of the independent statements around the
diff -- assignments, declarations, and stores -- and re-gate each permutation. colorsweep automates
five such rewrites but only adjacent ones; a three-statement move is still yours to make.

More instances of the same law, all large-band matches:
- declare the loop counter INSIDE each `for`-init rather than one shared `int i = 0;` at the top --
  scope moves where the counter is materialised.
- declare the loop counter as the FIRST local declaration (decl hoist) to swap a callee-saved pair.
- move `int i = 0;` AFTER an adjacent memset/zero store so mwcc rematerialises `mov r1,#0` instead
  of copying a held register.
- parameter-as-cursor: replace `p = args + 2;` with `args += 2;` -- a fresh local sinks its
  definition to first use and lands at the bottom of the ladder.
- hoist the call-argument reads into locals defined BEFORE an intervening `%` so the object dies
  early and its register gets recycled.
- dummy pre-loop inits declared BEFORE the counter demote the counter to the last assignment.
- `0218558c` — REGPERM 6 to 0 by swapping ONE adjacent declaration pair inside the loop body
  (`int missing = 1;` / `int offset = ...`), giving offset r6 and the flag r5. Try the adjacent pair
  bracketing the wrong registers before permuting the whole list; `colorsweep --apply` does this
  rewrite for you on any source that already exists.
- `020dbae0` — outgoing-argument copies (`mov r1, r8` …) emitted ABOVE the stores before a call, where
  the ROM has them below: write the two stores of one value as a chained assignment,
  `b = a = value;`. Inert: bare declarations in either order, `int` locals, casts, store order.
- `021b1e24` — two field copies `dst->a = src->x; dst->b = src->y;` where the ROM loads `y`, then `dst`,
  then `x`, then stores both: pass both values through an inline setter, `Set(dst, src->x, src->y)`.
  A struct-member copy, locals in either order and reversed stores all miss.
- `0207dcf0` — writes into a struct follow SOURCE statement order, not member-declaration order.
  If the ROM stores `field8` before `field2`, write them in that order.
- `02163ccc`, `020d03fc` — when a whole callee-saved GROUP is wrong, split every local into a bare
  declaration at function scope and permute that list alone, leaving reads and calls in
  chronological order below. The ladder follows bare-declaration position, not assignment order,
  first declared taking the HIGHEST of the group: `base, alloc, slot, obj, list, node, idx` gave
  `base=sb alloc=r8 slot=sl obj=r7 idx=r6 node=r5 list=r4`. One list to permute, no instruction
  moved.
- **THE DIRECTION OF THAT LADDER IS NOT SETTLED — try both before permuting blindly.** Two of the
  three measurements run the OTHER way from `02163ccc`, first-declared taking the LOWEST:
  `021869b8` (396B, 103 bytes closed) put twelve bare declarations on `r4 … fp` in declaration
  order, and `02184354` (1816B, 14 bytes) put seven on `r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, sb, fp` the same way.
  Parameters take part in the same ladder and merge into the neighbour that outlives them, which is
  the likeliest reason the three disagree. Write the list, gate it, reverse it once; one compile
  either way.
- **A LOCAL THAT TAKES A LOWER REGISTER THAN THE PARAMETER IS DECLARED LAST OF ALL.** The parameter
  keeps `r4` whatever order the locals are in, while the ROM gives it `r5` and a long-lived local
  `r4`: bare-declare EVERY local at the top in its existing order and put that one local last
  (`021a51a4`, 23 bytes to MATCH; colorsweep and every permutation of the top four were inert).
  mwcc's simplify scans nodes in vreg order, and a local declared last is numbered lowest, so it is
  visited while its neighbours are still in the graph, survives that pass, and is coloured first.
- **A SINGLE BARE-DECL HOIST ROTATES A REGISTER CYCLE BY EXACTLY ONE STEP.** When the residue is an
  n-cycle among callee-saved registers (`r7->r8 r8->sb sb->r7`), you do not need to search the
  permutations: moving one bare declaration up one position advances the whole cycle one step, so
  n-1 hoists at most reach any rotation of it (`02184354`).

## ANOTHER PROJECT ALREADY WROTE DOWN THIS COMPILER'S RULES — GREP THEIR NOTES FIRST
`refs/sm64ds-decomp/notes/mwccarm-codegen.md` is ~4700 lines of measured mwccarm codegen rules for
the SAME compiler, organised by shape class, each entry citing the function it was cracked on; its
siblings are `ask-the-compiler.md`, `mwccarm-pragmas.txt` and `arm9-endgame.md`. Grep it for your
residue's shape before inventing a lever — it also records which classes it could NOT crack, which
tells you when to stop. Examples it settles outright: an equal-arm ternary on a call argument flips
argument emission order; loads-before-stores batching fires only in the ELSE arm of a guard; a fresh
loop counter per loop stops one counter's web spanning the function; register-web priority follows
VARIABLE IDENTITY, so the lever is swapping which NAME holds which value, not the declaration order.

## START FROM A SIBLING, NOT FROM THE LISTING — the cheapest lever measured
Three of the large-band matches landed on the FIRST attempt, and every one of them started by
copying an already-matched neighbour instead of composing C from the disassembly:

- the recursive mutex lock/unlock idiom copied verbatim from `RunAtExitHandlers_020015e8.cpp`
- `func_020d5b5c.cpp` cloned wholesale as a template -- same module, same
  `GetBattleContext` / `func_020d424c` / `func_020d40bc` / Invalidate+Clean call shape
- a wlist-style function transcribed literally, arguments and hoists included
- `021894b8` — the ov012 twin `func_ov012_02185af0` cloned wholesale, then three edits: one list
  base constant, one guard wrapped round an existing block, and one array shortened. A twin in a
  SIBLING OVERLAY is as good as one in the same module; diff the two listings and change only what
  differs.

**Do not cache a field the ROM re-reads.** `ov017:021b1d44` matched on the FIRST compile by reading
`self[0x21]` again at each of the two post-call sites instead of holding it in a local — that is what
emits the `ldrb` reloads. A call may clobber what you cached, so the ROM re-loads; a local does not.
Model a bitfield root as padding plus the field (`struct { char pad[0x5d00]; BitField area; }` over
`base + 0x26c`) and the `add`/`add`/`ldrh`/`lsl`/`lsr` sequence falls out.

Before writing any C, search the module (and `src/` at large) for a function whose call sequence,
prologue shape, and struct accesses resemble the target, and start from ITS source. A sibling
already encodes the project's idioms, its calling conventions, and the compiler settings that
matched -- reconstructing those from scratch is what burns tries. This is the highest-yield opening
move on the large band; treat "find the sibling" as step one, not a fallback.

## INLINE ACCESSORS ARE WHAT `opt_propagation off` WAS FAKING (main:02061c04, matched without it)

The ROM was built with propagation on; the developers kept values materialised with small `static
inline` accessors, whose return value mwcc does not fold into the arithmetic that follows it.

* An `int`-returning accessor over a `u16` load keeps `/ 2` signed (`add r,r,r,lsr #31; asr`); the raw load gives `lsr`.
* A `u8` field read through an accessor is loaded before the call's argument setup, which restores the ROM's staging order.
* `&((struct Blk *)p)[1]` leaves a stride temp mwcc cannot fold; it is materialised once and coloured first.
* An offset split across a cast and a member (`((Sub *)(p + 0x840))->bar` with `bar` at 0x1000) makes the
  backend create the combined add late, so it is coloured first — the address lands in the lower register.
* `*(short *)p -= lim;` keeps `sub r0,r1,r0`; `*(short *)p = x - lim;` becomes `rsb` + `add`.
* Fixed-point products through an `FX_Mul`-style inline keep the ROM's evaluation order.
* A derived pointer the ROM forms ONCE (`add r6, r5, #0x9c`, then `mov r1, r6` at every use) is an
  array element reached through an index: `&res->allocator_array_38[index]` in a `static inline` called
  with `5`. `res + 0x9c`, `&res->allocator_array_38[5]`, a member, a named offset local, a round trip
  and every pragma are re-formed at each use (`ov023:021eeaac`; `&saved->records_.clears_[i]` called
  with `0` in `02186388`). A member-function accessor on a pad
  struct over the base works the same: `struct H { char pad[0x164 - sizeof(SafeAllocator)];
  SafeAllocator allocs[2]; SafeAllocator* GetAllocator(int i) { return &allocs[i]; } };` then
  `((H*)g)->GetAllocator(1)` keeps `add r7, r5, #0x164` live across calls (`main:0206f81c`).
* A field read twice through one accessor call that the ROM loads ONCE into a register is one call
  bound to a local (`EntFlags* fl = GetEntFlags(ent, 1); a = fl->bit0; b = fl->bit0;`), with the
  accessor indexing an array of fixed-size blocks, `(EntFlags*)&ent->blk[i]`, rather than a flat
  offset; a ternary store `x = !c ? 0 : 2` that mis-schedules is an `if/else` (`ov008:02189c70`); `o->f = a ? a : b` split into if/else stores swapped an sb/fp pair (`021bc77c`, colorsweep r19); with the first-defined local assigned first it closed an r7/r8 swap colorforce had traced to push order (`021a86d0`). A copy the ROM emits BEFORE the following compare is written in BOTH arms of the if/else, not once after it (`021e80e4`, colorsweep r32).
* A flag set to 1 early in a case (`flag = 1;`) shares a block with another `= 1` store, is CSE'd with
  that constant temp and coloured wrong; move it down to just before its use to get `mov sl, #1 ;
  mov r1, sl` (`main:0206f81c`).
* Two `unsigned char` values the ROM computes into callee-saved registers before intervening calls
  (`lsl r0, r6, #2 ; and r7, r0, #0xff ; add r0, r0, #1 ; and r8, r0, #0xff`) come from an accessor
  `static inline unsigned char GetScriptIndex(int slot, int offset) { return slot * 4 + offset; }`
  called with 0 and 1; plain `unsigned char a = j * 4;` locals are forwarded into the call
  (`ov017:0219bfb4`).

Strip the pragma first and fix what moves; a source that matches only under the pragma is in the wrong basin.

## PRAGMAS ARE A DIAGNOSIS — `wgate` REFUSES ANY SOURCE THAT CARRIES ONE
The ROM was built with every pass on, so `wgate` answers `RESIDUE PRAGMA` for any `#pragma` but
`define_section`. A pragma is only ever a scratch probe, read through `wdiff`, that names WHICH pass
moved the code. Then delete it and write the source that pass cannot reorder: a worse number
without the pragma is the right basin, a better one with it is not.

- **`optimize_for_size off` closes it:** if-conversion predicated an arm the ROM branches. The arm
  is usually one instruction short (the size boundary is under "Predication vs branch"), or the arms
  are inverted (`r24_arm_invert`). In a library block (`lib_ranges.txt`) the pragma stands in for
  the library build: delete it and gate again; the gate compiles there with that library's build,
  e.g. mwccarm 2.0/sp1p2 `-O4,p` for the SDK (`020d16b0`, `020d3160`).
- **`opt_propagation off` closes it:** propagation sank a constant past a store the ROM puts it
  before, staged nothing where the ROM holds a constant in a callee-saved register across a call,
  folded a variable index into the base add (ROM: two immediate adds and a register-offset load), or
  folded an accessor's result into the next constant. Use a small inline accessor (above), a plain
  local (below), or a re-read (`reread`).
- **`opt_common_subs off` closes it:** CSE cached a value the ROM re-loads. Re-read it at the second
  use (`reread`) or read it through an accessor.
- **`opt_dead_assignments off` closes it:** the ROM kept a store mwcc deletes, often the one that
  puts an extra callee-saved register in the `push`. Find the later reader the original gave that
  value.

### ROUTE A FOLDED `&global` THROUGH A PLAIN LOCAL, NOT `opt_propagation off`
When the target materialises `&global` early and keeps that pointer live, but your build folds the
address into the use, the pragma is not what the developers wrote. Route every access in that
section through a plain local (`page = &data_ov004_02170dd0; page->cursor`, `02162108`, 1024 -> 25).

Caching a field in a local is the same lever pointed the other way: re-reading `p->b` at its second
use site, instead of holding it in a named local, is what settles a callee-saved swap between the
two values (`021538e4`, REGPERM 8 to size-exact). `colorsweep`'s `reread` rule generates it, so the
sweep reaches this without a hand edit.

## A DEAD ARGUMENT SETUP MEANS THE CALLEE TAKES MORE PARAMETERS THAN IT USES
Target sets up an argument register the callee never reads (`mvn r1, #0` before a one-parameter
call)? The source passed it anyway: the callee's real prototype takes that parameter. Give the
callee one prototype that its definition and every caller share; a per-file redeclaration with a
different parameter list, or a call through a cast function pointer, is not what the developers wrote.

**A TWO-REGISTER REGPERM CAN BE A MISSING CALL ARGUMENT — check the arity before permuting.**
A pointer the ROM loads into r1 just before a one-argument call is that call's SECOND argument:
`func_02046a8c(list, node)` with the loaded node passed, as another committed caller already does.
Grep committed callers of the callee for its real arity first (`021688dc`, the `+0x370c` load).
In the same function, a count stored into an unrelated earlier local (`globalBase`) swapped a
callee-saved pair; its own `int count` closed it, the reverse of reusing a local.

**AN ARRAY ELEMENT INITIALISED FIELD BY FIELD** addresses each store as `add r1, sp, #(base+field) ;
str rV, [r1, rOff]` with `rOff = k * size`, and materialises `&arr[k]` only afterwards for bitfields
and calls. That is `arr[k].field = v;` per field, not a `T* p = &arr[k];` (which stores off one base
register) and not a `static inline` init (too big: mwcc emits it out of line) (`ov017:021abba8`).

## SCRATCH REGISTERS (r0-r3, ip, lr) ANSWER ONLY TO OPERAND ORDER

- **A copy-loop pointer and counter can be members of one local state object** (`main:0201647c`).
  Keep `short* source` and `int index` in a typed local struct when separate locals swap r3/r5.
  Initialize and advance the same fields at the same sites; replacing only that state object
  with separate scalar locals gives REGPERM 7, while the grouped fields match.

**ARGUMENT CONSTANTS SET BEFORE THE ADDRESS THEY SHOULD FOLLOW = TYPED CONSTANT LOCALS.** An `int`
local holding a literal is propagated into every block, so the call gets `mov rN, #imm`, which loses
the pass-1 tie to an address `add`. An enum-typed local defined in an earlier block is not propagated
across blocks: its uses become register copies that win the tie, as the ROM's `mov r1, #0xc00`
ahead of `add r0, r4, #0x800` shows. `enum PairTableSize { kPairTableSize = 0xc00 };` then
`PairTableSize size = kPairTableSize;` passed to the call (`02185634`). A field read into an
enum-typed local before a range test (`Kind cur = (Kind)actor->kind; if ((unsigned)(cur - KIND_3)
<= 2)`) swaps an r0/r1 pair that an `int` local leaves (`02162dc4`).

**CHECK THE FUNCTION'S OWN RETURN TYPE, NOT JUST ITS CALLEES** (`ov017:021ce5b4`).
A scaffold's `void` is a guess: if the target leaves a derived pointer in r0 on
success and each already-null call result in r0 on early exits, returning that
pointer can close a scratch-register residue. Two inline nested-member accessors
preserved the 0x134 adjustment here; changing `void` to `void*`, returning the
fields pointer, and returning the checked pointer on each null path closed
REGPERM 17 at the default flags. Literal `return NULL` instead added two redundant
`moveq r0,#0` instructions. Check the value in r0 on every exit before inferring
a return contract; a forced diagnostic object is not evidence of a source match.

A scratch-register swap in the diff is fixed by swapping the operands of the commutative operation
that feeds it (`pad/probe_scratch.cpp`):

    (s64)a * b   ->  smull r3, r1, r0, r1 / subs r0, r3, r2 / sbc r1, r1, r2, asr #31
    (s64)b * a   ->  smull r0, r3, r1, r0 / subs r0, r0, r2 / sbc r1, r3, r2, asr #31

Byte-identical and therefore useless: binding the product or the result to a local, one inline
expression, hoisting an operand first. Declaration order is a CALLEE-SAVED lever and does nothing
here. Each site is independent — with several such blocks the answer may be swapping one and not the
other, so give `colorsweep` depth for the combinations instead of rewriting by hand.

### A CALLEE-SAVED ROTATION IS VREG NUMBERING — set it by declaration order (`0215d63c`, `021615bc`, `0216049c`)
Simplify scans vregs in ascending order and the last node pushed takes the lowest free register, so
"X must colour before Y" means X needs a HIGHER vreg number. Declared locals are numbered in REVERSE
textual order regardless of scope: to raise a number, declare it EARLIER; to land between two
block-scoped locals, move the group to function scope in the order you need (`021615bc`, 75 -> 0).
`python $KIT/pad/renum/renum.py <src> <mod> <addr> <size> X=<rank>` forces a numbering in the real
compiler (`X=86.5` = between v86 and v87) and tells you which rank closes it. colorforce `order_0` +
`renum 83=105.5` named a whole-function swap that a bare function-scope `void* root;` declared just
above the pointer it must outrank closed (`021575dc`). Loop locals declared bare in reverse colour
order above the first call result (`int i; int total; Node* node;` then `Events* ev = f();`)
assign r6/r8/sb/sl in order (`021552a8`). A loop index declared bare above the initialised flag it
rides with (`int x; int picked = 0;`) swaps their callee-saved pair (`021dd3dc`). When renum shows an index product (`i*6`, an IR CSE
variable because it spans blocks) numbered too early, and every member spelling (`a[i].f`) leaves
it there, bind the element first and name the byte offset: `Val* v = &vals[i]; int off = i *
sizeof(Obj);`, then address the parallel arrays through `off` (`021d2d64`). Last resort only.
Declaration order only moves locals that KEEP their own vreg. Check first with
`pad/renum/vdump.py`: if a local's number does not change when you move its declaration, the lever
is dead for it. Two kinds ignore it: loop-body shorts/chars and CSE'd loads that become IR temps (a
low band), and backend temps (the split of an out-of-range `ldrh` offset, pool/constant loads),
numbered above every IR vreg. Hoisting ALL loop-body locals to the top of their branch, C89 style,
with the counter declared last, is a lever of its own (`021ddf5c`, 106 -> 54).
When the callee-saved registers are over-subscribed, the clique's last optimistic-spill victim is the
CHEAPEST node, cost = number of basic blocks that reference it; the victim takes the last register
(`fp`). To move the victim from one local to another, change which one a block reads: `lo = 1.0f`
instead of `lo = hi` (same asm after CSE) shifted one reference and flipped it (`021fa7ec`, 67 -> 6).
An explicit `else { keep = 1; }` on a flag already initialised to 1 adds a referencing block the
same way and moved the spill onto the ROM's loop counter (`02190884`, OPERAND 39).
A compound float op (`hi *= 0.8f`) puts the constant in r1; `hi = hi * 0.8f` puts it in r0.
When the ROM loads the argument above an earlier test in the same block, declare it at the block's
top: `{ Random* battle = ctx->battle; if (*state == 0) { if (!f(battle, *b)) ...` (`021e9f68`,
SCHED 11 as `f(ctx->battle, *b)`).

**A NARROWING `and` SCHEDULED AFTER A RUN OF TABLE LOADS = INITIALIZER-ARRAY COPIES IN THE SOURCE**
(`021eb578`). Each initializer-array copy lowers with a throwaway stack-address instruction that
delays the `and` past the loads, which keeps `screen` live across them so it colours r0. Write the
copies `*(Bytes2*)priorities = *(Bytes2*)&data_ov023_021fd844[8];` and store an int `screen` straight
into the bitfield; no separate narrowed `screen8` local.

**A load that cannot move past a store = an alias edge mwcc added** (`021de124`, decompiled). An
access through an unresolved pointer is worst-case; an access to a known object (local static,
const, local) is exact unless its alias falls outside the object. Alias propagation double-counts
the immediate on `ldr rX,=s; strh [rX,#k]`: the access lands at (2k, size), and if 2k+size >
sizeof(s) the WHOLE object joins the worst-case set and every pointer load now depends on it. So
a struct declared smaller than the real object makes stores look aliasing: give the struct its true
size (look for other files touching higher offsets). The reverse: when the ROM HAS an edge between
two stores, they hit the same object; write both through one base (`*(u16*)&((Oam*)&tbl[0].b)[n]`
instead of a second extern at +4), and a narrow local (`char`/`short`/`bool`) spilled with a 4-byte
`str` runs past its object and goes worst-case, so two such spill stores depend on each other: type
them to get or lose that edge (`0218d2f4`, `0218c04c`). `schedforce` names it as an `mwar`/`mraw` edge;
`pad/renum/aliasdump.py` shows the alias behind each query.

**Several globals read off ONE base literal, with different alias edges per field = separate
objects DEFINED in the file** (`0215ef14`). mwcc addresses objects its own file defines through the
section base, so `ldr rX,=A; ldrsb [rX,#5]; ldrsb [rX,#9]` comes from `signed char
data_ov004_021707e8[6]; Tail data_ov004_021707f0;` defined (not `extern`) in the source. One struct
over both stays SCHED 27 (wrong alias edges); two `extern`s give one literal per object (OVERGEN).
Size each defined object up to the next symbol, or dsd refuses the file's `.bss` range.

How the numbers are assigned (decompiled): IRO temps `@N` first (newest first, the low band), then
declared locals in reverse declaration order, then lowering temps (operands before the op, a for
condition after the body), then pcode-expansion temps (offset splits, constants). An IRO temp appears
when an expression is REUSED, including a short promoted to int twice; its number overrides
declaration order, so remove the reuse (hold the narrowed value in a wide local:
`int key = (short)(idx[i] + 12);`, `021ddf5c`). `x = e` is a temp plus a copy that CSE deletes unless
a call or a block with 2+ predecessors intervenes. Coalescing merges copy-related vregs and keeps the
LOWER number, so an unreachable rank is usually a missing or unwanted coalesce:
`pad/renum/vdump.py <src> [vreg...]` prints the IR before coalescing (a copy reads `mov =A B`), and
`pad/renum/forcemerge.py <src> <mod> <addr> <size> A:B` tests merging that pair.
Write a loop base as a plain expression inside the address, not a variable or helper
(`(Elem*)(lists + 0x8000) + j`, `021e0638`).
A counter that ignores declaration order was renumbered below every local by common-subexpression
elimination re-reading a dominated `ids.v[i]`: type the counters and the count `long` (SDK `s32`)
so the conversion is not merged (`0215d63c`, 185 -> 0; `0215440c`). A leftover `cmp a; cmpne b` is operand
order, not colouring: sweep the condition spelling.

### TWO SCRATCH VALUES SWAPPED WITH NO OPERATOR BETWEEN THEM — the value created LAST gets the LOWER register
Colouring pops a stack that simplification fills in value-creation order, so of two values
simplified in the same pass, the one your source creates later is coloured first and takes the
lowest free register. `int state = self->state; G.elapsed += dt;` gives state r3 and the loaded
`elapsed` r2; the ROM has state r2, fixed by `G.elapsed += dt; int state = self->state;`
(`ov023:021f4c04`). A single-use plain load is forwarded to its store and cannot be reordered this
way; bind it through an inline accessor instead (`Entry* e = obj->GetEntries();` before
`obj->GetTable()->SetEntries(e, n)`), which creates the value before the base (`02184a4c`).
A struct copy (`Vector3i endPos = self->position_;`) defined before a chained-offset pointer
(`res+0x2b4` then `+0x3400`) swaps that r1/r2 address pair the same way (`0219344c`).
Same for a compare operand: `signed char cv = cells[cur]; if (cv == n)` swaps the reloaded byte
and `n`; field reads bound through inline accessors before the index load create the base temps in
ROM order (`02169eec`).
The scheduler still emits the state read where the ROM does, UNLESS the store
in between may alias it: a store into a non-const global does, and pins the read below it, so first
make that object a static in an inline accessor (see "A CONSTANT HOISTED ABOVE A GLOBAL'S POOL
LOAD"). colorsweep `r5_stmt_swap` makes the move. To find which value to move,
`python $KIT/frida/colorforce.py <src> <mod> <addr-hex> <size> <pool-offset-hex>`
flips one colouring decision at a time and names the flip that makes the function exact.

### TWO LOADS IN SWAPPED SCRATCH REGISTERS — load both into their locals, THEN transform each
Two back-to-back loads (`ldrsh r3,[r0,#0xac] ; ldrsh r2,[r0,#0xae]` where the ROM has r2/r3), each
feeding its own shift or cast, with statement order, declaration order, raw locals and getters all
inert: load both values first, then transform them (`ov023:021e63bc`, 6 bytes -> MATCH):

    int x = pos[0];
    int ytop = pos[1];
    x = (short)(x << 3) + 0xa;
    ytop = (short)(ytop << 3) + 0x10;

The second load then stays live across the first transform, whose temp is coloured earlier and
takes the lower register. Loading and transforming x before loading y does not do it. colorsweep
`r55_load_then_transform`.

### TWO STRUCT COPIES THE ROM INTERLEAVES — the destinations are in two stack objects
The ROM forms both copies' source and destination addresses before the first `stm`; ours finishes
the first copy before forming the second's (`0219e384`). Splitting the one frame struct in two, with
the two destinations in different structs and the frame size unchanged, gives the ROM's order.
Inert: a copy helper in any argument order, a pointer local per address.

### A SINGLE-DEFINITION LOCAL IS RE-DERIVED AFTER A CALL — give it a second definition
`int prev = i - 1;` is forward-substituted: mwcc reloads `i` and recomputes `i - 1` after the `bl`,
where the ROM kept it in callee-saved `fp`. Assign it to a variable that already has another
definition (`idx = i - 1;`, reusing a dead parameter) (`021d8c30`).
A function-wide swap decided by one high-pressure loop: bind the ELEMENT address once
(`SafeAllocator* alloc = &self->allocs[2]; alloc->Reset();`, pass `alloc`) instead of a base plus
`&alloc[2]` at each use (`02155e28`). An index local shared by two read-modify-writes is an
element pointer per site instead: `int* pA = &arrA[e->slot]; *pA = f(*pA);` closed an r7/r8
swap colorforce named as one vreg order (`021f9874`).
A pointer coalescing onto a base's register (`entries = tbl + 4` sharing `tbl`'s r7) is the same
fix: share ONE function-scope variable between that case and another loop so it has two
definitions (`021f2e6c`). Same when two values sit in each other's callee-saved registers and
declaration position is inert: store the late call result into an EARLIER function-scope local
(the loop's `node`) instead of a fresh one (`0216033c`). Scratch registers follow the same rule: a
field re-read into the function's existing `col`/`row` locals, col first, before
`self->table[row * self->cols + col]` fixes an r2/r3/r4 trio that fresh locals cannot (`021f8e1c`).

### A LICM TEMP TAKES ITS SPILL SLOT AFTER THE LOCALS DECLARED BEFORE IT
Two spilled values in each other's slots: a named pointer local (`codes = row->codes;`) is slotted
in declaration order; deleting it and writing `row->codes[i]` makes the hoisted address a compiler
temp created later, which swaps the slots (`021d8c30`). The reverse also works: naming a
per-iteration pointer (`char* pairs = models->unknown_cc + i * 0x70;`) right after the alloc local
gives the LICM base temp the lower slot even though the add is still re-emitted (`021b3e14`).
For a pair fed from one value, the
assignment chain is the store order: `keepDefault = textKind = x;` stores `textKind` first.
A pointer the ROM spills to the TOP slots, above the LICM temps, is a backend split temp: the
source reaches it as ONE member at its full offset (`+0x684`), not through the `+0x284` sub-object's
`+0x400` field. That gives it a high vreg and the top slot (sp+0x3c, sp+0x38 in `02161380`). A
register holding a partial sum (`save+0x324`) with `#0x2400` re-added at each use is the same
split: one access at the full `+0x2724` fixes a function-wide callee-saved swap (`021adcb0`). A
loop-invariant pointer at an unencodable `+0xdf8` bound before the loop does the same and also
schedules its load ahead of a result copy (`021e33b4`).
Prefer a struct member at that offset over raw `(u8*)` arithmetic; both compile the same.

### A ZERO WRITTEN AFTER CONSTANT STORES TAKES THE OTHER SCRATCH REGISTER
`generic = 0;` written after `soundId = 3; textKind = 1;` is hoisted above the compare into r1 and
swaps r0/r1 through the block; written BEFORE them it lands in r0, as in the ROM (`021d8c30`).

### A NAMED ADDRESS LOCAL MOVES THE INVARIANT HOIST — write the address at each use
`flags = self + 0x195b; ... *flags |= 1;` hoists the loop invariants in a different order from
`*(self + 0x195b) |= 1;` written at the use. A copy-modify-store (`int cur = F; cur += step * 16;
F = cur;`) is an in-place update in the ROM, with the copy's only shift folded into its
initialiser: `int old = F >> 4; F += step * 16; int n = (F >> 4) - old;` (`02065990`). colorsweep
`r52_inline_address_local`, `r53_update_in_place`. A hardware port is its absolute address
(`*(volatile u32*)0x04000504`), never a negative index off another port's pointer: OVERGEN 8
(`ov005:02155258`).

### A MULTIPLY-ACCUMULATE PICKS ITS ACCUMULATOR FROM THE SOURCE — bind the multiplicand
`int x = A * K + B;` lets mwcc make the ADDEND the accumulator: it loads `B` first and makes `B`'s
register the `mla` destination. When the ROM loads the MULTIPLICAND first (often into `ip`) and
writes the result to a fresh register, bind the multiplicand to the result local and self-assign:

    int cur = A;                 // main:0205f9cc — ldr ip,[r2,#0x488] / ldr r0,[r2,#0x48c]
    cur = cur * K + B;           //                 mla r3, ip, r1, r0

Commutative-operand swap (`B + A * K`) does NOT reach this — mwcc canonicalises it back. Neither do
a named local for either operand, a struct or pointer local for the base, or any pragma. This is
`colorsweep`'s `mlaacc` rule, so a sweep finds it; what it leaves behind is a plain colour that
`declmove` closes.

## `add rN, sp, #0` IS THE ADDRESS OF A LOCAL AT FRAME OFFSET 0
mwcc never folds it into the instruction that uses the address.

## `stm rD, {rX, rY}` NEEDS TWO DISTINCT VALUES — a repeated constant cannot fuse
mwcc fuses consecutive word stores into `stm`/`stmib` only when the values sit in distinct,
consecutive registers (`pad/probe_stmpair*.cpp`):

    void f(S* p, u32 x, u32 y) { p->a=x; p->b=y; ... }   ->  stm r0, {r1, r2}
    void f(S* p) { p->a=0; p->b=0; p->c=0; p->d=0; }     ->  mov r1,#0 + four str

Two zero locals collapse to ONE register, and `stm {r1,r1}` does not exist. Inert against it:
`opt_common_subs off`, `opt_propagation off`, a walking pointer, `*(u64*)&p->a = 0`,
`optimization_level 4`, `opt_unroll_loops on`. Struct assignment is worse — in a `-lang=c++` TU it
emits a real `operator=` call.

So if the ROM shows an `stm` pair and your fields are all zero, the source did NOT store literal
zeros: those registers hold two different variables that happen to be zero. Work out what they are
from the callers; no zero-fill shape fuses.

## A PARAMETER'S CALLEE-SAVED REGISTER IS ITS POSITION — nothing in the body moves it
Parameters take callee-saved registers in REVERSE parameter order, immovably
(`pad/probe_calleesaved*.cpp`):

    f(a, count)     -> mov r5, r0   mov r4, r1
    f(a, b, c)      -> mov r6, r0   mov r5, r1   mov r4, r2

Use order, rebinding a parameter to a local, that local's declaration position, and pointer-vs-int
type all leave it identical. So a whole-function swap of two parameters' callee-saved registers means
**the signature is wrong, not the allocation** — wrong parameter order, or an extra/missing
parameter shifting every position. Re-derive it from which of r0-r3 feeds each callee-saved register
in the ROM listing; the scaffold's ARGS line is a heuristic, not evidence. No sweep rule reaches this.

**An extra parameter shifts the ladder only when it is LIVE.** A dead one is stripped before
allocation, so padding the signature to move a register does nothing: on `ov017:021941fc` the
one-parameter form and `(ov, int arg1, int arg2)` gate BYTE-IDENTICAL.

With locals competing, the ladder is DEFINITION order, highest register first (one parameter plus
four call results gives `r8, r7, r6, r5, r4`). A parameter counts as defined at ENTRY, so it takes
the HIGHEST. If the ROM holds it in a LOW one, the ROM does not keep it live from entry — it
re-loads the value later, which defines it late. Find that reload rather than permuting declarations.
Caveat: a value whose live range spans a loop can outrank definition order, so treat the ladder as a
first guess. That holds with FEW locals competing; with many it inverts. On `ov017:021941fc` (eleven
named locals) the parameter took the LOWEST rung in all six permutations of the competing locals, and
the ROM performs no reload — the load appears exactly once, in the schedule slot we already emit.

The full ladder is **`sl, sb` for the parameters, then `r8 r7 r6 r5 r4` descending for the locals,
then `fp` last** (`pad/probe_r9.cpp`, eight call results chained into one sum). Two consequences:
`sb`/r9 IS allocatable — a ROM that uses it is not using a register our build reserves, so never
reach for a compiler flag; and `fp` is taken AFTER r4, not in numeric order, so a ROM holding a value
in `fp` has defined it later than everything in r4-r8, not earlier. When your set and the ROM's set
differ by WHICH registers appear rather than by their order (`0201edf0`: the ROM uses `sb` and never
`r6`, we use `r6` and never `sb`), the ladder start has shifted because something is live at entry
that is not live at entry for us. That is a signature or a live-range difference, not a colouring
one, and permutation sweeps cannot reach it — two of them have already failed on it.

Four measured consequences, each from the function that proved it:
- `0204bab4` — hoisting ONE declaration out of a `for`-init to function scope, leaving the others in
  place, swapped the whole r4/r5/r6/r7 assignment. `colorsweep` spent 80 compiles and found nothing;
  the hoist did it. If a permutation sweep stalls, move a declaration across a SCOPE boundary.
- `0222170c` — declaring the odd-one-out local LAST rather than first rotated the stack slots back
  by one and closed the residue.
- `020b3bac` — two SAME-SIZE stack objects take their slots in declaration order, so swapping them
  decides which lands at `sp+0` and which at `sp+0xc`. (Differently sized objects do not obey this;
  model that region as one struct instead.)
- `0208ec78` — hoist a local that SHARES a callee-saved slot with another value into its own
  declaration statement above it. Declaration order, not just assignment order, decides which freed
  register mwcc reuses.
- `02037d88` — a call that both branches of a block share belongs BEFORE the dispatch, not after.
  Written after, it takes a different callee-saved register and every local behind it shifts.

## A LOOP COUNTER'S DECLARATION POSITION COLOURS THE POINTERS AROUND IT
When callee-saved pointers come out as a register permutation (REGPERM on r7/r8/sb) and permuting
their own declarations is inert, move the LOOP COUNTER. A counter declared at function scope, placed
among the pointer declarations, changes which pointer's register it coalesces with; declared after
every pointer, or inside the `for`, it pairs with the wrong one.

    void* axis; int i0; int i1; int i2; Modes* modes; char* battleCtx; ...    MATCH  (02021578)
    void* axis; Modes* modes; char* battleCtx; ...; int i0; int i1; int i2;    22 bytes

Move the counters as a BLOCK — moving one of the three got 10 of the 22. A `for (int i ...)` counter
must be hoisted first: a bare `int i;` emits nothing, so no instruction moves, and any position after
the first pointer matched `020227dc`. Moving a declaration that carries an INITIALIZER moves the
instruction with it and costs more than it saves. On `02021578` all 36 orders of the pointers were
inert.

### A CALLEE-SAVED LADDER FOLLOWS DECLARATION ORDER — unless a post-increment renames the variable
Declared scalars are numbered in reverse declaration order, and the busiest ones take callee-saved
registers highest number first: declared earlier = lower register. `x++` inside an index
(`ids[count++] = c;`) splits `x` into a new, late-numbered variable that is coloured after every
declared one; write `ids[count] = c; count++;`. Two loops that share one counter share its register;
if the ROM gives them different registers, give each loop its own counter (`02169b4c`, `021dce34`, `02162108`). A flag
accumulated alongside a call (`mask |= N;`) goes BEFORE the `Store(g, count++, ...)` call when the
ROM sets it first; same for a local assigned in an arm before its call, and for two increments
ahead of a call taking `&idx`: `count++; idx++;` puts the plain counter first (`02192700`). Hoist the block's
scalars to bare declarations and search their order with
`python $KIT/pad/declperm.py <mod> <addr> <template.cpp> <decls.json>` (template holds `/*DECLS*/`);
`ov023:021eeaac` 68 -> 19 that way. Check a hypothesis before writing it:
`python $KIT/pad/cf_multi.py <file.cpp> ovNNN <addr> <size> <pool_from> '{"moves": [[idx, pos]], "choices": [idx]}' --order`
reorders or flips mwcc's colouring and prints the node order.

### THE SAME LEVER ORDERS SPILL SLOTS
Scalars that spill get stack slots in declaration order, first declared = highest address; a local
declared with an initializer at its point of use lands in the LOWEST slot and shifts every spill slot
above it by 4 — a diff full of `[sp,#0x5c] | [sp,#0x58]` rows. 12-byte struct locals follow the same
rule (`02176634`, 47 -> 0; `0217df08`, a pointer declared last to take the lowest slot sp+0xc). A 1/0
flag written `changed = (a | b) ? 1 : 0;` instead of if/else stores is a compiler temp, and
compiler-temp spills sit below the declared scalars (`0219d250`).

### A LITERAL-POOL OFFSET DIFF CAN HIDE A WRONG CONSTANT — compare the VALUES, not the offsets
`ldr r0, [pc, #0x584] | ldr r0, [pc, #0x58c]` reads like pool-layout noise and usually is. It can
also mean ours loads a DIFFERENT constant: mwcc lays the pool out in first-use order, so one wrong
literal early in the function reorders the whole pool and every later load shifts with it. Run
`python $KIT/pad/poolmap.py <mod> <addr> <file.cpp>` before chasing any of them as a schedule: it
prints every `ldr [pc]` with the VALUE it reads in the ROM and in our build (relocated pointers
resolved to their symbol's address), and marks each row VALUE (a wrong constant — fix the source)
or offset (same constant, different slot). `ov025:021ebb90` had two constants swapped
(`1.8f` passed where the code used `&data`, `4096.0f` multiplied where the code used `1.8f`); fixing
the VALUES cleared four "offset" runs at once, 31 -> 24.

### WRITE A LOOP-INVARIANT INSIDE THE LOOP WHEN THE ROM COMPUTES IT AFTER THE LOOP INIT
If the ROM initialises the loop counter FIRST and only then stores an invariant (`j = found` reload,
then `codes = node + 0x14` to its slot), a `codes = node->codes;` written before the `for` comes out
in the wrong order. Write it as the FIRST statement of the loop body instead: mwcc's loop-invariant
pass hoists it into the preheader, which comes AFTER the `for`-init. Flags reset next to it may have
to be `unsigned char` (or `bool`) — with `int` flags the same move changed the size on `021ebb90`:

    unsigned char found = 0; unsigned char blocked = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < node->codeCount; j++) {
        codes = node->codes;                                // hoisted after j's init

`ov025:021ebb90` 24 -> 14.

The same shape with no local at all: `and r0, fp, r0, lsl r8 ; mov r7, #0 ; str r0, [sp, #0x10]` and a
reload of that slot inside the loop is the condition `if (present & (1 << current))` written in the
loop body. A `flag = present & (1 << current);` before the `for` stores before the counter init, and
no declaration or statement order moves it (`ov023:021eeaac`, the last 19 bytes).

## TYPE WIDTH IS A REGALLOC LEVER — `int` vs `unsigned char` on the same value
- **An extra soft-float conversion can mean one payload word has two types** (`main:02056d80`).
  Model a keyframe word used as both a float channel value and an unsigned duration with a union
  containing `float y` and `unsigned int duration`. Convert the duration member directly to float;
  casting the floating member through unsigned int adds a conversion and OVERGENs by 4 bytes.

A byte-typed local sourced from a `ldrb` changes which callee-saved pair mwcc picks. When the diff
is register NUMBERS around a byte value, retype it before touching anything else:

- `int id = *ids;` instead of `unsigned char id` flipped an r8/sb callee-saved pair.
- SIGNEDNESS PICKS THE MNEMONIC. A struct field typed `int` rather than `unsigned int` makes
  `f >> 2` emit `asr` not `lsr`, and `f >= 0x38` emit `blt`/`bge` not `blo`/`bhs`. When the only
  wrong mnemonics are shift or compare flavours, retype the FIELD, not the local (`020c0a40`).
- an `unsigned char` compared `> 0` folds to `!= 0` (`movne`/`bne`). A `movgt`/`bgt` right after
  the `ldrb` means the compare was signed: write `(int)p->field > 0` and keep the field
  `unsigned char` (`021c5c5c`).
- `ldrsh` then `lsl`/`lsr #0x10` into an `unsigned short` local is a `(short)` read of a u16 field:
  `value = (short)p->field;`. The plain read emits a predicated `ldrh` and the function comes out
  12 bytes short (`02155d54`).
- a flag passed to a `bool` parameter is a `bool` local; an `int` converted at the call costs
  OVERGEN 16 (`ov005:021589f4`).
- a u16 field packed into a register word with `lsl #16` at the load and `lsr #16` at the `orr`
  is truncated at the load, `unsigned int a = obj->tex->f50 << 16; REG = 0x6e500000 | (a >> 16);`.
  A `(unsigned short)` cast at the store creates the value after the pool constant and swaps the
  callee-saved pair around it (`02066cf0`).
- `mov rN,#0` / `blt` / `movle rN,#1` / `cmp rN,#0` is a range flag written in the body:
  `int party = 0; if (id >= 0 && id <= 3) party = 1; if (party)`. An inline returning the test is
  OVERGEN 4, and the same flag inside a `static inline` stops it inlining (`021e62cc`).
- a spilled `str` of a parameter at the very front of the prologue means the parameter is `short`;
  a 0..3 range test on it as its own `static inline` taking `short` keeps the 0/1 result in r0
  instead of a conversion temp (`021da9e0`). Its reloads from that slot then carry memory edges
  that hold the next store and a following `mov` above them; as `int` it is SCHED 11 (`021df924`).
- a byte array read whose `ldrb` the ROM schedules before a neighbouring array address: the element
  is a struct of one `unsigned char count : 8;` bitfield, read as `data->rank[i].count` (`0218aa24`).
- Keep a packed value in an `int` local so only the genuinely narrow call site pays for the
  truncation; typing the local `unsigned short` emits `lsl`/`lsr #0x10` at every use (`020307d0`).
- a u16 member accessor whose result the ROM truncates once into an `unsigned short` local and
  compares untruncated elsewhere is read through a helper returning `int`:
  `static inline int GetField06(GameObject* o) { return o->obj3D_.GetField06(); }` (`02191cc0`).
- three separate `and rX,sl,#0xff` for ONE integer argument are per-call implicit conversions to an
  `unsigned char` PARAMETER, not source casts. Change the callee's parameter type; do not write
  casts at the call sites.
- the reverse also happens: a redundant `(unsigned char)(1 << (i % 8)) & 0xff` -- cast AND mask --
  is what pins the byte-set tail's `ldrb` before the mask AND.
- when one value feeds two call sites with different widths, SPLIT it: give the call-result site its
  own named `unsigned char` local so the truncation fuses there and not at the other site.
- **byte-param coercion beats a source cast** (`020703c8`; `short` params too, `02157b74`): three separate `and rX,sl,#0xff` for ONE
  integer argument are per-call implicit conversions to an `unsigned char` PARAMETER. Written as
  `(unsigned char)x` casts instead, mwcc CSEs them into one callee-saved register and overflows into
  fp. Declare each callee with `unsigned char index` and pass the int bare.
- `unsigned char` locals get stack slots in REVERSE declaration order (last declared = lowest sp
  offset).
- **a local's width decides where its LOAD is scheduled** (`021665b0`; params and locals typed `short`/`unsigned char` took `0204cd60` from LOOP-SHAPE 3272 to MATCH): locals loaded from `short`
  fields must be typed `short` too; as `int` their `ldrsh` stays grouped instead of interleaving
  with neighbouring zero-inits. Locals reused across switch cases go at FUNCTION scope so the cases
  share one spill slot / register (UNDERGEN 12 there).
- **spilled locals whose reloads are HOISTED above neighbouring stores** (`021eb5d0`; `unsigned char` length vs 7u, `021539d8`): type them
  `short` like the value they hold; as `int` mwcc schedules their spill loads early. Making them
  address-taken or struct members fixes the order but moves the slot: wrong basin. Same function:
  `const short id = ...` fixed a function-wide r7/r8 swap; halfword copy loops were struct
  assignments; 8-byte pairs were `unsigned long long` passed by value.
- **byte-typed FLAG locals block constant propagation** (`021e6a90`): a spilled `int ok = 1` /
  `forced = 1` / `mode = 0` gets folded into its uses; typed `unsigned char` it stays a real value,
  so an inline reuses it (`ldrle` reload), its store sinks below the neighbouring `mov`, and a reset
  that writes `0.0f` emits the `mov r0,r0` copy. Retype flag locals when those three symptoms show.
  A flag passed only as the last argument of a call also wants it: `unsigned char n = 0;` keeps its
  `[sp,#8]` reload below the global store and closes UNDERGEN 4 (`02161514`). `bool` works the same
  for a spilled per-iteration flag: its word-sized spill is a worst-case alias, so each arm's field
  loads schedule after it (`021fd954`, SCHED 64 -> 0).
  Same for a predicated loop flag (`021dcf14`, `02159900`): as `int` its `streq` lands before the adjacent
  conditional store; `unsigned char` puts it after. A global whose store pins later loads there
  was the inline-accessor static (see "A CONSTANT HOISTED ABOVE A GLOBAL'S POOL LOAD").
- a truncation the ROM does UNCONDITIONALLY (`and #0xff`, not predicated `andeq`) is a narrow local bound before the `if` (`unsigned char b = v;`) (`02159d0c`).
- **byte-typed ACCUMULATORS** (`0208ec78`): a counter you increment/decrement takes the target's
  `and rX,#0xff` truncation after each step only if the local is `unsigned char`. An `int` counter
  emits none, and the gap shows up as a whole-function instruction-count shortfall, not as one bad
  register. An `int` counter with an explicit `(i & 0xff) < N` bound emits the same mask but colours
  the scratch registers around it differently (`02072398`): when the mask matches and only those
  register numbers differ, retype the counter `unsigned char` before any colouring lever.
- **signedness picks the mnemonic** (`02005ac4`): `unsigned` operands give `lsr`/`bhi`, signed give
  `asr`/`bgt`. Read which pair the target uses and type the local to match before touching anything
  else.
- **a `short` local keeps its spill reload BELOW earlier stores** (`021ebb90`): mwcc spills a `short`
  scalar with full-word `ldr`/`str`, and hoists an `int` spill's reload above the previous store but
  not a `short`'s. When the only diff is a spilled scalar reloaded one instruction early (above the
  preceding store), declare it `short`. If it is assigned from a call, also declare that callee as
  returning `short`, or the new truncation costs more than it saves; the return type is not part of
  the symbol, so the link is unchanged. Inert for this: `volatile` (reloads everywhere), address-taken
  (loads once), a narrow ternary assigned into an `int`. colorsweep `r51_short_spill`. A spill
  `str` scheduled ahead of an argument `mov` is the same lever: a `short` flag from a callee
  declared returning `short` (`021e4c04`). The reverse also happens: a spilled `unsigned char`
  table index whose spill store lands before the indexed `ldr` wants `int` (`021f454c`).
- **a local that copies a field takes the FIELD's type** (`0219e384`): `unsigned char kind`,
  `unsigned short value`, `unsigned char tag = detail[1]`, and the callee assigned into `value`
  declared returning `unsigned short`, put a spilled store ahead of the next load at two sites.
  As `int`s, mwcc schedules the load first.
- **a narrow local BLOCKS CONSTANT PROPAGATION** (`ov026:021d8ba0`): where the ROM RELOADS a value
  it could have kept in a register — `ldr r0,[sp,#0x60]` before each of several stores — declare the
  source `unsigned char` instead of `int`. mwcc propagates a constant through `int` locals and emits
  one `mov r0,#0` plus plain stores, but it will not propagate across the implicit conversion, so
  each read becomes a real reload. The narrow local still takes a full word slot, so nothing else in
  the frame moves. That one retype closed a 12-byte whole-function shortfall. Inert at the same site:
  chained versus separate assignments and an aggregate holding the flags.

## A RESIDUE THAT WILL NOT MOVE IS POINTING AT CODE YOU INVENTED
When a site resists every form you can think of, stop generating forms and read the whole file for
constructs the original developers could not have written. A file-wide `#pragma` is the obvious one,
but so are: a template or macro system for field access (`At<O,T>`, a `PAGE`/`FLD` pair, several
spellings of the same access chosen per site for their codegen), a variable reused to hold two
unrelated things, an expression that stores inside another store's operand, a cast of one object to
several different struct types. Each of those changes what mwcc knows about ALIASING and about which
values are common subexpressions, which is exactly what decides scheduling and register choice — so
one of them is usually why the last site will not move. Replace them with the natural form (ONE typed
struct with named members, accessed as `self->field`) and re-measure, accepting a worse number to get
into the right basin (`ov026:021d8ba0`).

## A CONSTANT HOISTED ABOVE A GLOBAL'S POOL LOAD — THE GLOBAL'S STORAGE CLASS DECIDES IT
Symptom: a store into a global is followed by a store through a pointer, and the ROM emits the
second store's constant FIRST (`mov r1,#3 ; ldr r0,[pc,#N] ; mvn r2,#0 ; str r2,[r0,#0x18] ;
str r1,[sl,#0xeac]`) where ours emits the pool load first. Statement order, declaration order, flags,
compiler builds and every spelling of the two statements are inert.

Cause: mwcc puts every non-const global in a worst-case alias set, and two stores that may alias get
a dependency the scheduler must honour. A static declared inside a function is left out of that set.
The member offset is also counted twice in the lookup, so the object must be at least twice the
member offset plus the member's width, or the lookup falls back to worst-case anyway.

Fix: make the object a function-scope static at its TRUE size — the gap to the next symbol in
`symbols.txt`, never the offsets your function happens to touch. When any other function references
the object, put the static in an inline accessor so it has a linkable name:
`inline T& GetT() { static T s = {...}; return s; }`. A static in the function body becomes a local
`s$N` symbol that no other object can link to. Both halves are required: a function static at a
guessed size, or the true size at file scope, leaves the residue byte-identical (`ov026:021d8ba0`).
Keep every other global `extern`.

The same size test decides loads through an `extern` struct that models another file's `.bss` block
(a TU's statics, reached from its section base): declare the struct at the block's TRUE extent, the
`.bss` range its owner has in `delinks.txt`. At 0x80 or 0xe0 the loads reorder; from 0xe8
(2 × 0x68 + 0x18) it matches (`ov031:02204c84`, SCHED 26 → MATCH).

## A COMPARE AGAINST A HOISTED REGISTER IS AN ENUM-TYPED LOCAL
Symptom: the ROM materialises small constants before a loop (`mov r7,#1; mov r6,#4`) and compares
against the registers (`cmp r0,r7`), where every literal, `#define`, enum constant, `const` or `int`
local folds to `cmp r0,#1`. mwcc's propagation pass only replaces a variable whose use has the same
type as its assignment. An enum local read in an `int` compare never folds, so it stays a register.
Declare and assign it next to its use, inside the loop:
`WcmcMsg found = WCMC_MSG_FOUND; if (msg == found)` after the receive (`0224599c`). Assigned before
the loop, the same locals colour differently. One `mov rN,#1` shared by both arms of an `if` whose
arms are not predicated is the same lever: `OnFlag on = ON_FLAG;` before the `if` (`02204e38`).

## A FRAME THAT IS THE WRONG SIZE IS NEVER A COLOURING PROBLEM
If `sub sp, sp, #N` disagrees with the ROM, every sp-relative byte in the function is wrong and no
register rewrite and no colorsweep run can touch it. Fix the frame FIRST, and measure it:

    python pad/framemap.py <module> <addr> <your.cpp>

It prints both frame sizes, every stack slot each side touches, and the first rank where the two
lists diverge -- everything below that rank agrees, so the object just under it is the one whose
size is wrong.

Every local 0xc too high with an `ldm`/`stm` copy from the lowest slot is a struct RETURNED BY
VALUE: declare the out-pointer callee returning the `Vec3` (`Vec3 Select(Entry*);` mangles the same,
the return type is not in the name) and write `Vec3 to = Select(entry);`. The result lands in a compiler temp at the bottom of the frame
and is copied into the named local (`021b8e8c`).

A `#pragma opt_common_subs off` or `#pragma opt_dead_assignments off` in your file is a SIZE bug
waiting to be counted, not a lever: it keeps a store the ROM folded away and blocks a reload the ROM
performs. Delete both before reading any size verdict. On `main:02048e2c` that alone took OVERGEN 4
to size-exact. Which local lands in which callee-saved register follows the order the values are
FIRST WRITTEN, not the order they are declared: `int r; int w = 1; r = w;` emits `mov r4, #1; mov
r3, r4` where `int w = 1; int r = 1;` emits the constant twice in the other two registers. A local
declared WITH its initializer takes its place from that write, while a bare `T x;` takes its place
from where the DECLARATION sits, wherever the assignment ends up. Hoisting the writes that must own
r5/r6/r7 above the first call fixes the ladder before it (`021767ec`, SHAPE 102 -> REGPERM 9).

`push {r3, r4-fp, lr}; sub sp, #0x38` in the ROM against your `push {r4-fp, lr}; sub sp, #0x3c` is
the SAME 96-byte frame: mwcc reserves an odd word by pushing a scratch register rather than widening
the `sub`. Read it as "my locals are one word too large" -- take a word out of the frame and the
prologue flips to the ROM's form by itself. Every sp-relative offset moves with it, so settle this
before reading any other difference in the diff.

Two levers, in this order:

1. **Merge duplicate block-scoped scratch objects.** mwcc gives every block-scoped aggregate its own
   slot and never overlaps two blocks, so `{ struct Node n; } ... { struct Node n2; }` costs the
   frame twice. One function-scope object reused by both blocks costs it once. On `ov017:0219e384`
   this alone took the frame from 0x298 to 0x228 (two `NodeScratch`, one duplicate `Msg`, two
   duplicate `Vec3`).
2. **Then correct the SIZES of the structs you guessed.** Declaration order and scope do not move the
   frame SIZE: mwcc's total is the same however you arrange the objects (re-measured on `0219e384` --
   moving the biggest local to function scope and declaring it first changed nothing). Only the sizes
   move the frame. Work out what each object must be from the ROM's own slot list: the gap between
   two consecutive `add rX, sp, #N` sites IS that object's size.

   They DO move each aggregate's OFFSET inside the frame, which is what a wrong `add rX, sp, #N`
   with a right frame size is telling you. The local aggregates form ONE band, FLOOR-anchored at its
   lowest address, filled in REVERSE lexical declaration order -- the first declaration takes the
   highest offset and each later one stacks downward -- and every block-scope aggregate is placed
   BELOW every function-scope one, so hoisting one to function scope lifts all the block-scope ones.
   Predict each offset from that rule before you compile; it was exact 4 times out of 4 on
   `ov026:021d8ba0`. The corollary is a trade-off to watch for: an object you move for its own
   offset's sake also shifts every aggregate above it, and a function-scope object you delete stops
   being the spacer that held the band where the ROM has it.
- `unsigned short saved = f->x; f->x |= 0x4800;` instead of an int temp + cast stops the u16
  truncation sinking to the store (`02037934`).

## CONSECUTIVE BITFIELD WRITES MERGE INTO ONE STORE — count the stores, not the writes
For a run of N consecutive writes to the same bitfield STORAGE UNIT, mwcc emits N read-modify-write
sequences and exactly **ONE** store. The merge is keyed on the resolved storage-unit address, not on
how the lvalue is spelled: two differently-named bitfield structs inside a union, two union members
at the same offset, and a different declared base type (`unsigned long` vs `unsigned int`) all merge
identically (`main:0209a218`).

**Bitfield vs raw-word spelling moves scheduling function-wide** (`0215436c`, 26 -> 0). Model a flags
word as a union and write each bit the way the ROM does: 1-bit bitfield writes for single-bit sets,
a raw-word `|= 0x400` where the ROM ORs a constant. No statement order reproduces the tie-breaks.

So a ROM with TWO stores to one slot a few instructions apart is telling you its writes are in two
DIFFERENT runs, and the C must contain whatever ends the first one. **No pragma reaches this** —
`opt_dead_assignments`, `opt_lifetimes`, `peephole`, `opt_common_subs`, `opt_dead_code` and
`optimize_for_size` were all measured inert with the pragma plumbing verified working, so the merge
is front-end/IR, not an optimizer pass.

A may-alias cast (`*(unsigned int*)((char*)&rec + 4) &= …`) DOES split the store, but it marks the
object address-taken: it costs an `add rN, sp, #0` and perturbs the surrounding schedule. If the ROM
has neither, the ROM's source contains no cast and no pointer write — look for a write to a
different storage unit, a call, or a branch between the two instead.

Corollary for the residue: widening or splitting a field changes the RUN LENGTH, so `f4e:7` split
into `f4e:3 + f4f:4` buys an extra instruction slot. That is a diagnostic, not usually the answer —
it produces two narrow `bic`s where a single field produces one wide one.

## NAMED LOCAL vs CSE TEMP — this is what decides SPILLING
mwcc gives a memory home to a NAMED local and keeps CSE temporaries in registers. When your spill is
in the wrong place, the lever is whether the value has a name at all:

- REMOVING a name is as much a lever as adding one. `0205bd78` — deleting the count/ptr locals and
  reading `s->fieldNN` at every site moved the spill onto the loop bound the target spills
  (209 -> 192 -> 27 bytes). `02012538` — deleting a named bool and writing the two stores out under
  `if`/`else` let mwcc keep the sequence in `r0` and predicate it.
- `02098a84` — the converse across a LONG range: a value the ROM holds in a callee-saved register
  across a whole block is one the source reuses at the far end. Bind it once (`resetSlot =
  &arr[last]`) and use that variable at both ends; two textually identical `&arr[last]` expressions
  resolve independently and never produce the long-lived register.
- the reverse, same function: materialise both bounding-box sums into locals
  (`int right = a + c;`) BEFORE the `if`, which stops mwcc sinking the ldrsh loads into the
  short-circuit chain and emitting `addge` instead of an unconditional `add`.
- `02089630` — hoist a field into a named `unsigned int` local before a call to PARK it in r7.
- `020e1438` — write the store block as `out[count].field` (indexed) instead of hoisting an entry
  pointer, to force the mul result into r6 and the address into r2.
- `0208ec78` — give a bitfield extraction its OWN named local (`mask = 1u<<j; idbits = (w<<7)>>24;`)
  instead of inlining one side under `&`/`|`. That forces mwcc to materialise `idbits` fully into a
  register and fuse the mask's shift into `tst`/`orr`, which is the fusion side the target chose.
- `02084a64` — initialise a shared result local AT ITS DECLARATION (`unsigned int result = 0;`)
  rather than leaving it uninitialised. It then holds one stable register across a whole switch, and
  every case stores into it via `mov` — which is what produces a shared branch-to-tail epilogue
  instead of an inline `pop` per case.

Ask "does the target keep this in a register or on the stack?" and add or remove the NAME to match.

## NATURAL FORMS THAT MATCH WHERE A TRICK DID
Each was a byte-exact replacement for an invented construct; write these first.
- A cast never fixes a type; pointer casts emit no code. `reinterpret_cast` is refused outright, and
  one value cast to the same type twice (`static_cast<MapEntryList*>(self->unknown_ptr_41c4)`, `021a5cbc`)
  means the member or return type is wrong: type the header member or the callee's return value once
  and every cast goes. A `void*` getter its callers read as different types gets a C++03 inline template
  in the header, `template <class T> T* GetEntry(int i) { return static_cast<T*>(GetEntryRaw(i)); }`,
  the one cast written once. An object passed as `self` is `this`: write `Class::Method`, not
  `F(char* self)` with byte offsets (`020678bc`).
- A flag local copied from a compare (`cc = r0 - 0; if (cc == 0) goto L;`) is a structured `if`/`else`
  on the value itself (`02158038`, `02186dc8`, `021dcc8c`, `02184324`).
- An 8-byte `{fn, locator}` pair copied whole and dispatched by testing `locator & 1` is a C++
  pointer to member function: `typedef int (Obj::*Handler)();`, `table[8] = handler;`,
  `(obj->*table[i])()` (`021dc488`, `021b228c`).
- A null test the ROM re-reads is an inline predicate on the owner,
  `static inline bool HasInner(const Outer* o) { return o->f0 != NULL; }` (`020bc158`, `020bc1ac`).
- A local copy of a table read through `int* w = (int*)&copy;` is a struct with one array member indexed
  directly, `struct Words4 { int v[4]; }; Words4 w = table; w.v[i] = x;`. The pointer alias moves
  loads and stores around the copy; the array member restores the ROM's schedule (`020733d8`).
- Byte tables a symbol apart read at a shared stride (`data_X[row * 3]`, `data_X1[row * 3]`, `data_X2[row * 3]`)
  are ONE array of row structs, `struct Row { u8 a, b, carry; }; extern const Row data_X[];`, read
  `data_X[row].a`. Three externs load three pool literals in the wrong order; one row array restores it (`021fb490`).
- An offset added to reach an embedded sub-object is a member accessor, `Sub* GetSub() { return &sub; }`
  (`021e62a8`, `0215707c`).
- Two words loaded together and stored through `r0`, whose caller passes a stack temporary, is a struct
  returned by value: `FSFileID NNS_SndArcGetFileID(void) { return arc->fileId; }`. Written as an out
  parameter the stores fuse into `stm` (`020bd88c`).
- A null test on `&node->allocator` is a null test on a member accessor's result:
  `SafeAllocator* GetAllocator() { return &allocator; }`, `SafeAllocator* const allocator =
  node->GetAllocator(); if (!allocator) return 0;` (`02164084`; `0208bf78` without the `const`).
- Shift-and-mask on one field is a real bitfield (`int field58 : 3;`, `02087e6c`; `021eb3e0`).
- Adjacent globals indexed together are one struct (`struct InputLog { u8 countA, countB; s8 logB[8],
  logA[8]; }`, `020a1df8`, `020a1ef0`).
- Register and OAM bit access is the NitroSDK inline or union (`G2_GetOBJPosition`, `02225c90`;
  `GXBg01Control`, `02074b64`).
- `cmn rN, #1` then `bgt`/`ble` is a compare against a -1 sentinel the source really wrote: `id > -1`
  or the header's enum, `id > BackgroundLoader::TaskStatus_Invalid` (`0205308c`, `02184acc`);
  `id >= 0` compiles to `cmp rN, #0` and never matches it (53 of 53 sites).
- Parameters named for registers and reassigned mid-body hide a real signature: an init that zeroes
  typed fields and returns its object (`021d98b8`, `0215a920`), a getter or setter on a typed global
  (`021dd024`, `021dcee8`), a script handler `int f(Script::Parameter* params, int count)`
  (`0218b6bc`, `02188014`).
- A callee that fills a caller's matrix or vector returns it by value, `Mtx43 m = RotationMatrixY(a);`;
  a const member returning a struct binds to a const reference (`02018f6c`, `020321e0`, `02048690`).
- A cast call `((int (*)(int))f)(x)` or a private `extern "C"` alias is the shared prototype from the
  callee's header or another caller (`02077e80`, `02097cac`, `020dcd40`, `021551d4`).
- A byte-offset cast `*(T*)(obj + 0x9b4)` is a field of the object's struct, typed as the ROM loads it
  (`02046e08`, `020559cc`, `0208f68c`).
- An inline getter that matches only as `{ short v = c->hp; return v; }` carries a compiled-out assert:
  `{ SDK_NULL_ASSERT(c); return c->hp; }` (`globaldefs.h`). Any statement before the `return` makes mwcc
  expand the body where the calling statement starts; a plain return is folded into the expression.
  34 of 35 files (`021e4c04`, `0201a300`, `0215bb7c`). A raw `0x027ffc3c` read is
  `OS_GetVBlankCount()`, `return *(volatile unsigned long*)0x027ffc3c;` (`0202d6c8`).
- A struct copy the ROM makes into a local nothing reads (`ldm`/`stm` to the stack, never loaded back),
  which only `volatile` seems to keep, is a local of a type with an empty inline destructor:
  `struct Vec3 { int x, y, z; ~Vec3() {} };`, `Vec3 rot = *(Vec3*)((char*)c + 0x50);`. Every other form
  is dead-store eliminated. mwcc emits the destructor out of line; the build empties it, as the
  original `-dead` link stripped it (`0216c00c`).

## BREAKING CSE — re-read what the ROM re-reads
**A RELOAD THE ROM KEEPS IS AN ACCESSOR OR A REAL FIELD, NEVER `volatile`.** Bind an inline accessor's
result to a local before the call (`BaseCombatStats* stats = GetBaseStats(c);`, `02069158`,
`0206918c`; `int a = o->GetF7c(); int b = o->GetF80();`, `020bd88c`; three header accessors in place
of a `volatile` parameter, `020dc07c`), or give the field its struct type and write the compound
assignment: `o->flags |= 0x400;` (`021f2348`).
**A CACHED LOCAL IS A CLAIM THAT NOTHING IN BETWEEN WROTE THAT MEMORY, and the ROM rarely makes it.**
Re-read instead of caching whenever calls sit between the two uses: a field after three mutating
calls (`02184bbc`, the target's second `add`/`ldrsb` pair), a predicate the function has itself been
mutating — call it AGAIN rather than testing a held flag (`021ea85c`, 500B, matched on the first
compile) — and a plain redundant `ldr`, written by naming the field again at the use site
(`020307d0`). A spill slot that goes to the wrong temp can be the same lever: writing
`menu->visibleCount - (menu->count - (menu->last - first))` instead of reusing a `span` local creates
the `menu->last` reload's temp first, so it takes the top spill slot; call arguments bound to
locals (`px`, `py`) leave only the address constant to be hoisted out of the loops (`02029988`).
`02188d9c` — `const` is the OPPOSITE lever and it moves whole blocks, not one load: declaring an
extern lookup table `extern const short tbl[]` means `int` stores through an unrelated pointer can
no longer alias it, so eight `ldrsh` hoist above the store block and their index adds materialise up
front. When the target loads EARLY and you load late, ask what mwcc thinks your stores might alias.
`02188ba0` — a plain source split forces a reload without `volatile`: breaking `a && b` into a named
flag set by the first test and read by a SECOND `if` makes mwcc re-load the pointer field on the
equal path. Same address: a constant already live in a register changes how a NEIGHBOURING constant
is materialised — with `int missing = 1;` in scope above the bind, `-1` came out as `sub r1, r3, #2`
instead of `mvn r3, #0`. If a materialisation is one instruction off, look at what is live, not at
the expression. A constant that does not fit one instruction is built by add/sub from the constant
assigned most recently in source order, so assignment order picks each base: reorder the constant
assignments to the ROM's derivation chain (`hdr - 0x1c4` needs `group` assigned first) before
touching the expressions (`02177dd4`, UNDERGEN 4 -> MATCH).

When the target RE-LOADS a value you are holding in a register:
- A register restored from a saved field, `ldr r0, [base] ; ldr r3, =mask ; ldr ip, [self, #off] ;
  and r0, r0, r3 ; orr r0, r0, ip`, is an SDK setter whose mode parameter is an ENUM:
  `static inline void GX_SetOBJVRamMode(GXOBJVRamMode mode) { DISPCNT = (unsigned int)((DISPCNT & ~0x300010) | mode); }`
  called as `GX_SetOBJVRamMode((GXOBJVRamMode)self->saved)`. Written inline, every operand order and
  local either emits `orr r0, ip, r0` or colours the register bases one lower; an `unsigned int`
  parameter is inert too (`ov003:0217e6b0`, the last 5 rows).
- A register field CLEARED with a hoisted `mov rN, #0` feeding an `orr` (`ldr ; bic ; orr rN` where
  ours emits `bic` alone and schedules the neighbouring RMW differently) is an SDK setter called
  with 0, not `REG &= ~mask`: `static inline void G2_SetBG3Priority(int p) { BG3CNT =
  (unsigned short)((BG3CNT & ~3) | p); }` then `G2_SetBG3Priority(0)`; same for
  `POWCNT1` bit 15 via `(sel << 15)` (`ov017:021c0850`).
- A pool-literal load scheduled AFTER a neighbouring `ldrh`/`sub` pair when the ROM has it first is
  a wrong prototype on a nearby SDK call: `GX_DisableBankFor*` / `Disable*VRAMBanks` return
  `unsigned int` even when discarded; declared `void`, the scheduler reorders (`ov017:0218b688`).
  A discarded `int` return also adds pcodes that move the ~100-pcode block split one statement,
  which changes the next block's schedule (`0218b5c4`, `EncodeSignFlaggedHalfword`).
- A byte store through a pointer loaded from a struct slot that takes the swapped scratch pair is a
  typed accessor plus an inline member setter: `GetBattleHud(res)->SetVisible(1)`, not
  `*((u8*)res->ptr + 0xa) = 1` (`ov017:021acdf4`, `ov017:021b790c`).
- A register copied to the stack TWICE and then reloaded (`str r1, [sp, #4] ; ldr r3, [sp, #4] ;
  str r3, [sp, #8]`) before bitfield reads is an inline returning the register struct by value:
  `static inline GXDispCnt GX_GetDispCnt(void) { return *(volatile GXDispCnt*)&DISPCNT; }`. Without
  `volatile` there is one stack copy and the frame is 4 bytes short (`ov003:0217e6b0`).
- An I/O register (`0x04000000`…) read twice in one update is the SDK's volatile register type
  behind a get/set inline pair. `GX_SetVisiblePlane(GX_GetVisiblePlane() | 0x10)` needs both as
  `static inline` functions over `volatile unsigned int`; one inline expression orders the `orr`
  before the `bic` (`02065418`). A plain `GX_SetVisiblePlane(obj->planes)` read once colours its
  scratch registers only as `(obj->planes << 8) | (reg & ~0x1f00)` (`021c17fc`, `021a9768`).
- Mixing access forms splits a pointer CSE: cached local for the read side, global-deref for the
  store side (`0223d0b4`).
- The MIRROR CASE: when the target reuses the register from a nearby COMPARE, write the arithmetic
  on the literal, not on the field. In a `field == -16` arm, `-16 + 15` reuses the compare's `mvn`
  register; `field6a + 15` re-loads the field and picks a different one (`020db3f4`).
- read the field TWICE rather than reusing an expression: `n = l->count; l->count = l->count + 1;`
  not `n + 1` — that supplies the extra mov/ldr the target has (`0209f030`).

## CONTROL-FLOW SHAPE — the lever for predication, tail-sharing, and branch order

- When a short-circuit prefix check advances its cursor before the last byte comparison,
  consume the prefix with `*p++ == A && *p++ == B && ...`, then continue parsing from `p`.
  Indexed checks followed by `p += N` in the success arm sink the advance past that comparison
  (`ov031:02204368`, 11 bytes to MATCH).

- **One soft-float conversion after a branch means the arms produce a float** (`main:02017d90`).
  Assign each arm's rounded value to one `float` local, then cast that local to `int` after the
  branch. Casting and storing inside each arm duplicates `_ffix` setup and OVERGENs by 4 bytes;
  the shared conversion matches with the default compiler.
mwcc predicates small arms and cross-jumps shared tails. The SHAPE of the source decides both, and
this family closed more large functions than any expression change:

**SWITCH ARM ORDER CONTROLS PHYSICAL BLOCK ORDER** (`0206cbcc`). When a jump-table switch
has the right operations but wrong branch destinations, reorder its case bodies to match the ROM
before changing expressions. Keeping every body unchanged and sorting `-1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 4` into
numeric order changed MATCH into LOOP-SHAPE 32 with four differing branch targets.

**A CONSTANT THE ROM ISSUES BEFORE AN ALU OP WAS NOT IN THAT BLOCK** (`021e3178`). The first-pass
scheduler breaks ties by: critical-path slack, successors made ready, path height, then operand class
(an instruction that reads a register beats `mov rX,#imm` / a pool load), then IR order. So in one
first-pass block the constant always sinks; declaration order and loop spelling are inert. When the
ROM has `mov r3,#0` before `add r2,r0,#0x14`, the `add` was a loop-invariant address written INSIDE
the loop body and hoisted to the preheader after pass 1: move the address from a local bound before
the loop to its use in the loop, and stop the offset folding into the load with an int cast
(`((unsigned char*)((int)node + 0x14))[j]`). `pad/renum/schedwhy.py <src> <mod> <addr> <pick>` prints
which tie-break decided a schedforce pick. When 14 or more values are live in a block, pass 1
switches to a register-PRESSURE score: start 16, each register operand used for the LAST time
subtracts 1 + max(1, live-14), each def still read later adds max(1, live-14); lowest wins, ties to
earlier IR; latency and height ignored. r0-r3 between two calls in one block stay counted. Call
arguments are always set up in argument order, so a later argument's load issuing before an earlier
simple argument means the block was under 14 live, the calls sat in separate blocks, or that load
was its base's last use. Declaration order, temps and argument spelling cannot change it. A block
also splits at a named label, a C++ exception-region change, or after ~100 pcodes (`02157d40`,
`02165490`). Tools: `pad/renum/pressforce.py`, `pad/renum/schedwhy.py`, `pad/renum/renum.py`. In pass 2 two constant moves tie and IR order decides:
when the ROM sets `r5final = 0` before `kind = 0xf`, the variable whose value is used FIRST in IR is
created first; there the else-arm loops were counting with `r5final` (`0216033c`).

**A LONG STRAIGHT-LINE BLOCK IS SPLIT BY INSTRUCTION COUNT** (`0218b710`): mwcc ends a basic block
after the statement where the generated pcode count passes 100, and CSE/scheduling do not cross
that split. A constant CSE'd where the ROM reloads it from the pool (`add r1,r5,#3` for 0x7536 next
to 0x7533), or the reverse, means the split falls one statement off: change how many instructions
the statements BEFORE it generate (`int` returns, `char buf[0x80] = {0};` instead of a `__clear`
call). Pool words are emitted in first-use order: swap two stores to swap two pool words (`021e8d20`).

**A STATE CHAIN THAT IS SHORT** (`0215cc70`, UNDERGEN 64 -> 0): a materialised flag test
(`tst; movne #1; moveq #0; cmp`) is a one-line inline returning `int`, not `bool` (r20); a call
result tested `mvn; cmp; beq far; cmp #1` is `if (r != -1) { if (r == 1) ... } else ...` (r24).
Helpers with control flow or several statements are not inlined, nor is one that stores through a
parameter: write those bodies in place.

**THE ORDER OF TWO PREDICATED ARMS IS THE SOURCE ORDER OF THE IF/ELSE** (`02174a80`): `strhle` before
`asrgt` means the `<= 0` arm was written first: `if (x <= 0) { x = -1; } else { count++; }`.

**AN ARM THAT REFUSES TO PREDICATE HAS A CALL YOU LEFT OUTSIDE IT** (`0216acf0`). Read where the
ROM's `blt` lands: if it also skips the next call, that call belongs INSIDE the `if`
(`if (idx >= count) { idx = count - 1; Call(list, idx); }`). An early-reset arm that jumps past the
main body was a `goto` to a label after it, not `if`/`else`.

**AN INTERLEAVED MATERIALISATION IS THE SCHEDULER, NOT YOUR STATEMENT ORDER.** When the ROM threads
one statement's instructions THROUGH another's, no source order reproduces it — mwcc sinks each
definition to its use and then schedules. `main:0202c04c` (22B) and `main:020a1180` (34B) are both
this; every reordering gates the same or worse. Spend the session elsewhere.

**WHERE YOU ROOT A STRUCT DECIDES WHICH TEMP IS ALLOCATED FIRST.** Two spellings of the same field
can emit byte-identical instructions and still differ in registers. When a big constant offset is
not an encodable ARM immediate, mwcc keeps the partial sum as a temp and folds the rest into the
load offset — and the temp's allocation order follows how DEEP you rooted the object. Re-root one
level down (`(List*)(base + 0x9c + 0x400)` with the field at `+0x1c`, not `(Owner*)(base + 0x9c)`
with it at `+0x41c`) to make the POINTER the first-allocated temp and the loaded byte second.
`ov020:0218d32c` (792B, REGPERM 16). Naming the pointer, naming the call argument, flat `p[0x41c]`
indexing, `-O3`/`-O4`/`-opt speed` and an 80-compile colorsweep are all inert on the shallow root.
Two counters that must sit in the LOWEST stack slots after the arrays are one `int cnt[2];`
(`cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`), not two scalars, which slot in declaration order (`021ed634`).
`add r0, sp, #0xc8; ldrsb r0, [r0]` (address formed, then loaded) is a stack buffer tested through a
`char*` local: `char* n1 = bufc8; if (n1[0] != 0)`. `bufc8[0]` folds to `ldrsb r0, [sp, #0xc8]`
(`02185c90`).
Two bytes copied as a unit from a table are a `struct { unsigned char v[2]; }` assignment from an
`extern const` array of that struct: mwcc copies it byte-wise (`ldrb`/`strb` pairs), which a
function-wide SCHED residue at many sites can come from (`021560e4`, SCHED 65 -> 0).
A struct temporary's STACK SLOT follows its inline nesting depth: a copy made inside an inline that
is itself inlined lands in a different slot band than the same copy written in place. When only
Vec3-style temp slots are wrong (OPERAND on `add rX,sp,#N`), move each copy one inline level in or
out; a named const reference to a call result is laid out as a local, not a temp (`0216ba70`).
When an attempt is NOT matching, suspect your own scaffolding first: run `python $KIT/plausible.py <file>`
and remove what it flags (volatile locals, unused address-taking pointers, `x = x;`, chains of invented
one-line inlines). Those reach a lower number in the wrong basin; the original never had them.
Never `const int CAP = 999;` as a block-local: mwcc folds every use but still emits `CAP$N` into
`.rodata`, and integration refuses the unreferenced object (DATA-UNPLACED). Use `enum { CAP = 999 };`
or the literal (`0216033c`).
A zero-fill of a local buffer is `__clear(buf, n)`, not `memset(buf, 0, n)` (`02021f88`, which also
used separate out-param locals per state for the frame).
A FLAT non-encodable offset (`void* list = src->list`, list at `+0x684`) makes the partial sum a
compiler temp coloured below a hoisted address, where a named pointer to the `+0x284` sub-struct
took the other register (`021729ac`). Try both roots.
`0215b520`: name BOTH the rooted base (`ents` at `+0xa70`, array at `+0x1000`) and the CSEd offset
(`off = (k + 4) * 0x88`), define them where the ROM first needs them (after the first store, not at
the loop top), and use them only at the call sites the ROM computes that way. A `const` byte table
lets its `ldrb` hoist above a volatile store (also `02173954`, colorsweep r60). A pointer table the
same: `extern T* const tbl[9];` stops its load being ordered before a global store (`020d22f4`).
Inside a loop the same re-rooting is spelled as raw pointer arithmetic on the element:
`((int*)o + i)[0xac/4]` rather than `o->idx[i]` (`0218f088`).

**NAMING AN INTERMEDIATE DECIDES WHERE IT MATERIALISES.** One rule, two proven instances. An
expression written inline is sunk to its use and folded; bound to a local it is computed where the
binding sits, in its own instruction. Reach for this whenever the residue is one instruction in the
wrong place, in the wrong register, or missing entirely.

| shape | inline form | bound form | address |
|---|---|---|---|
| a call inside a compare always takes Rm, for BOTH operand orders | `if (x == Call())` | `int a = Call(); if (a == x)` — declared BELOW the loaded local | `02053634` 2B -> 0, `0209bed8` |
| a condition the ROM tests twice | folded into the enclosing `\|\|` | `int ok = (... == 3); if (ok == 0) return 0;` | `02094fe4` 12B |

Bounding rules for both: the bind must sit BELOW the value it is compared against (above gives
SHAPE); the local's type is free; inlining an already-bound expression at its use site DELETES the
instruction (UNDERGEN). Sibling sites in one function may legitimately want opposite forms — match
each site to its own instruction.

**AN EXPLICIT NO-OP `case` COSTS A DETACHED COPY.** `case 0: return;` written out gives mwcc a real
arm to branch to; deleting it and letting 0 fall through the jump table unhandled — exactly as the
out-of-range values already do — lets the shared one-instruction epilogue inline into the table slot
instead. Pair it with merging sequential `if (x) return;` checks into one `if/else` chain so the
fallthrough converges on the call the ROM shares. `main:02076df4` (488B) closed 12 bytes on the two
together. A switch arm that does only what "no arm" does should not be written.

**Predication vs branch, measured (`pad/probe_ifconv*.cpp`, `pad/probe_pragma_scope.cpp`):**

- **A pragma inside a function body does nothing** — mwcc binds optimization pragmas where the
  FUNCTION is defined, so bracketing one around a single `if` compiles byte-identical. "Tried it
  per-case, tightly bracketed" means the pragma never ran. A probe pragma goes at function scope.
- **`optimize_for_size off` at function scope does defeat if-conversion:**
  `tst / movne / strne / movne / strne` becomes `tst / bxeq lr` + the plain arm.
- **The boundary is a size: 4- and 5-instruction arms predicate, 6 branches** with no pragma, for an
  arm that FALLS THROUGH; an arm ending in `b` counts the `b`, so it branches at 5 body instructions.
  So "1 instruction short AND predicated where the ROM branches" is ONE bug — find the missing
  instruction and the branch is free.
- **An arm the ROM branches over that ours predicates.** Each arm is if-converted on its own: every
  instruction must be predicable and the arm must be <= 5 instructions (`b` included) at `-O2`. Game
  code is all `-O2`, so when the ROM leaves a short arm as a branch, the ORIGINAL arm held something
  non-predicable or was longer: a call, a volatile access, a store through a different base, an extra
  instruction. Find it. `$KIT/pad/renum/ifcvtrace.py <src> "<flags>"` lists every arm, its size and
  why it was or was not converted. Only in third-party library code (NitroSDK, DWC/NHTTP, the
  CodeWarrior runtime, MSL) can it instead mean the library was built `,p` (limit 3): there emit
  `BLOCKED <addr> SPEEDTU` (`0224185c`, `0200df80`).
- **A call in the arm always forces a branch**, including a hidden one (`x / 7` -> `bl __div`); so
  does a loop.
- **Inert, stop re-testing:** `goto` over the arm, `volatile` on the store target, and binding the
  guard to a local (`int g = x & 0x20; if (g != 0)` gives flag-setting `ands`, still predicated —
  only a use of `g` AFTER the `if` splits it).

- **if/else-if chain, not separate ifs** (`0205a528`, four magic-string checks): the first arm's `&&`
  false-path falls into the second compare; arms 2-3 need `else if` so their inner
  `if (fN()) return 1;` false-path BRANCHES past the rest to a shared `return 0`. Measured: separate
  ifs 34 bytes, nested-if-with-explicit-return-0 10 bytes, switch-on-call-result 102 bytes.
- **nest to force a shared tail** (`02077500`): putting three `return 1` paths inside
  `if (f() != 0) { ... } return 1;` makes them branch to the shared tail instead of emitting
  `movCC r0,#1`.
- **write it into BOTH arms** — duplication is a placement tool, with two distinct outcomes.
  `dst->f0 = dst->f4` in each arm makes cross-jumping merge only that store, restoring the target's
  `strhne` + `bne` (`02089630`); a pointer bind and its `src += 0x28` advance at the top of each arm
  get CSE-hoisted into the dominator block BELOW the tag load, so the load takes r0 and the advance
  materialises as a real `add r4, r4, #0x28` instead of folding into its merge-block uses
  (`0201d638`, 2452B).
- **one `||` condition, not two ifs** (`02003ddc`): `handler == (fn)1 || (handler == 0 && slot == 1)`
  gives the shared `mov r0,#0; pop` then-block plus the cmp/cmpeq fold.
- **switch instead of if/else** (`0223c308`) to stop mwcc hoisting a shared constant above the `bne`.
- **order the diamond** (`020ba264`): make the block the target falls through to the if-body and the
  other the else (56 -> 22 bytes).
- **READ THE POLARITY OF A PREDICATED COMPARE CHAIN — it names the operator.** `cmp a,b` +
  `cmpne`/`cmpne`/`cmpne` + `moveq r0,#1` is `a==b || c==d || e==f || g==h`: the first EQUAL sets Z
  and skips the rest. The same chain with `cmpeq` is the `&&` of the same equalities. They are not
  two shapes of one condition, they are different conditions, so a `cmpne | cmpeq` column in the
  diff means the SOURCE has the wrong operator, not the wrong colouring (`020cddec`).
- **two adjacent constants** (`02160f4c`): with the field bound to a local, `s == 0x54 || s == 0x55`
  becomes `sub`, a shift pair, `cmp #1` and `ls`-predicated stores (OVERGEN 20); reading the field at
  each compare keeps the two `cmp`.
- **backward `goto` into a label** reproduces mwcc's tail-merge of a duplicated reset block
  (`02002b90`).
- **EARLY RETURN vs SINGLE EXIT decides WHERE a returned constant is materialised — both directions
  are levers.** It also moves a call argument: `if (flag != 0) { stores; func(self); } else
  { counter++; } return;` schedules `mov r0, sl` after the state store where the guard
  `if (flag == 0) { counter++; return; }` does not (`02164400`). The same goes for a two-arm guard:
  positive-first `if (inParty) { calls; state++; } else { state += 2; }` splits a block the
  negated form keeps under register pressure (`021f0a5c`). Single exit keeps it live past the
  test so it must be materialised first
  (`020a1bb4` + its twin `020a1ccc`); early return out of the success branch instead makes the FAIL
  path materialise its `NULL` before the cleanup calls rather than sinking it to the final return
  (`0207568c`, 296B, 53 bytes — but only with `#pragma opt_propagation off` at function scope, which
  is evidence the real form has not been found). The single-exit direction, measured: an early return makes K dead on the fall-through path,
  so mwcc folds it into a predicated instruction instead:

        cmp r7, #0x23 / mov r0, #0   / pophs {...}      target
        cmp r6, #0x23 / movhs r0, #0 / pophs {...}      from `if (id >= 0x23) return 0;`

  Write it single-exit — `int ok = 0; if (id < 0x23) { ...body...; ok = 1; } return ok;` — and K is
  live past the test, so it has to be materialised first. You do NOT lose the early exit: mwcc still
  emits the conditional pop. `colorsweep` applies this automatically (rule r23), so reach for it by
  hand only when the returns are not plain integer literals.
- **A `switch` dispatches through a JUMP TABLE only if the last arm is a real `case N:`.** Writing
  it as `default:` makes mwcc emit a compare chain instead. `02005ac4` needed an explicit `case 3:`
  to get the target's table dispatch.

## LOOP FORM — mwcc -O2 does NOT rotate loops
A `while` emits a `b` to a bottom test; it will never become the target's top-tested do-while. Pick
the form directly:
- guarded do-while `if (n != 0) { do { ... } while (n != 0); }` for a top-tested loop (`022378e4` —
  both loops).
- An unsigned cursor's entry guard picks the branch: for `unsigned int offset = 0;`, keep
  `if (offset < size) do { ... } while (offset < size);` when the ROM skips entry with `bls`;
  `if (size != 0)` selects `beq` and leaves a one-byte residue (`ov031:022227ec`).
- `while (y < h) { ...; if (count >= max) break; }` plus an explicit `max == 0` early return
  (`020e1438`).
- A SIZE gap of a few bytes spread over several loops is usually this and nothing else: rewriting
  three zero-fill loops as guarded do-while moved `0x1f0 -> 0x1fc` in one edit (`020c0a40`). Fix
  loop form before you touch registers.
- Materialise a loop BOUND as its own named local declared ABOVE the `for` init clause. Folded into
  the condition, mwcc computes it last; hoisted, it is computed before the init `mov`s, which is the
  ROM's order (`020e2110`).
- `while (node)` with a break plus a redundant post-loop null test (`021982ac`).
- Test at the TOP and a `b` back to it at the bottom, with no guard: `for (;;) { if (!a || b) break; ... }`
  (`0218b5fc`, 137 bytes to MATCH in one edit; the wrong loop form also recoloured the whole function).
- An SDK-build loop left unrotated, with `mul`/`mla` recomputed each pass, touches an object the SDK
  declares `ATTRIBUTE_ALIGN(n)`. Declare the extern the same way, `extern SNDCommand data_02112a60[256]
  __attribute__((aligned(32)));`. A function that touches an aligned object skips loop optimisation
  (`020d2220`, SND_CommandInit).

## EXTERN "C" AND MANGLING — the WRONG-SYMBOL trap
Whether a declaration mangles decides both the emitted symbol and the argument widths. Get this
wrong and a byte-perfect function still fails the gate:
- if the config binds a plain `func_0XXXXXXX` name, the definition MUST be
  `extern "C" ARM void func_0XXXXXXX(...)` — a semantic C++ name mangles and fails WRONG-SYMBOL
  (`02020fc4`, found only after the bytes already matched). The bound name can also carry a
  DIFFERENT overlay number than the module you are working in — `021d8a40` is bound as
  `func_ov023_021d8a40`, not ov026. Read the name out of the config; never construct it.
- a `_Z` callee is a plain C++ declaration with exactly the parameters its mangling spells, called by
  its C++ name: `_Z25EnqueueEventTag8_021cc4b8hhi` is `void EnqueueEventTag8_021cc4b8(unsigned char,
  unsigned char, int);`, and a `_ZN<len><Class>...` callee is a member, called `obj->Method(...)` on a
  declared `Class`. NEVER `extern "C"` a `_Z` name, not even to change an argument width:
  plausible.py blocks EXTERN-C-MANGLED. When the real prototype adds an `and #0xff` the ROM lacks,
  the value passed was already that narrow type in the caller: retype the local or field feeding it.
  A parameter the mangling spells `j` is `unsigned int`; narrow at the call,
  `(unsigned char)(idx + 1) & 0xff` (`021539a0`; the cast or the mask alone stays SCHED 7).
- pool-word FUNCTION ADDRESSES resolve to mangled symbols too (`_Z22TransferMainObjPaletteiij`):
  `&TransferMainObjPalette` on the plain C++ declaration (`0222d1b8`).
- Mixed in one file is normal and is what let `0202b0f4` match FIRST TRY: mangled `_Z` callees as
  plain C++ declarations, `func_` callees as `extern "C"`, in the same source.

## BIG OFFSETS AND ADDRESSING
- **fields past 4095** (`obj + 0x1000` region) MUST be plain nested-struct member chains
  (`obj->sub.f28`) — never a local `Sub*` and never an inline accessor. The 4095 immediate limit
  already forces an `add rX,base,#0x1000` split, so mwcc rematerialises the base per block; a named
  local or `GetSub()` gets CSEd into a parked callee-saved register and adds a register to the push
  (`0202aec0`).
- `add rB, rX, #0x1840` + `ldr rF, [rB, #0xb34]` with the base in the lower register is a sub-object at
  `+0x840` whose field sits past 0xfff (`+0x1b34`): the backend splits that offset and merges its
  `#0x1000` into the `#0x840` add, so the base is a late temp and takes the lower register. Reach the
  sub-object through nested inline accessors, `SetGold(GetSave(ctx), bonus + GetGold(GetSave(ctx)))`
  with `GetSave()` returning `&ctx->save`, or the `(char*)ctx + 0x840` cast of 02061c04 case 0xd3.
  A member chain folds to `#0x2000`/`#0x374`; a sub-object taken at `+0x1840` swaps base and field
  (`0216c00c`, `02061c04`).
- use the project's existing one-pointer idiom rather than a base + re-offset local: canon splits the
  same constant either way but colours the two registers in the opposite order (`021b4f48`).
- read halfword field offsets straight off the canon splits: `add #0x100` + `ldrh [r0,#0x88]` means a
  u16 at 0x188 (`020d59bc`).
- a byte read and later cleared through ONE `add rX,gs,#0x7000` (`ldrb [rX,#0xf72]` …
  `strb [rX,#0xf72]`) is a member-array access, `*(unsigned char*)&gs->unk_6fc0[0x7f72 - 0x6fc0]`.
  `((unsigned char*)gs)[0x7f72]` splits the store as `#0x72`+`#0x7f00` into a second register;
  the plain `char` member gives `ldrsb` (`main:02000c9c`). A `char *` walked as `e[0]` / `e[4]`,
  or as the flag byte `el[0xc5]`, is the same `ldrsb`; the pointer is `unsigned char *`
  (`021544f4`, `0215c988`). Indexing an `int *` taken at the first field
  (`int *q = &s->id; short cur = q[1]; short id = q[0];`) is what keeps that base in one
  register. A `char *` plus the raw offset does not (`02160004`).

## A SMALL INTEGER LOADED FROM THE POOL IS AN OVERLAY ID — write `OVERLAY_ID(n)`
`ldr rN,=0x18` where a C constant would give `mov rN,#0x18` is the address of the LCF symbol
`OVERLAY_24_ID`. No constant spelling reproduces it. `#include "System/OverlayId.h"` and pass
`OVERLAY_ID(24)`; `relocs.txt` already carries the `kind:overlay_id` entry (`ovidrelocs.py`).
Consumers: `func_020a1940`, `func_020a1bb4`, `IsIndexMappedToSelf020a18f4`,
`BackgroundLoader::QueueLoadOverlay`, the third argument of `SetFields30And34_021b2bd0` (`02160da0`).

**The same ID re-loaded from the pool at the unload** (`ldr r0,=OV` before BOTH `func_020a1940`
and `func_020a1bb4`, no callee-saved copy) means the ID is POINTER-typed. `OVERLAY_ID(n)` casts to
`unsigned int`, and mwcc CSEs an integer into a callee-saved register; it never CSEs a pointer
constant, it rematerialises it. Declare the callee `func_020a1940(unsigned int* id)` in that file
and pass `&OVERLAY_19_ID`. Eight load/unload pairs, 36 bytes (`main:02000c9c`).

**A pool word at a section boundary is an LCF symbol too.** The arm9 LCF defines
`ARM9_<TEXT|INIT|RODATA|CTOR|DATA>_START`/`_END`. The static-initializer walk takes
`extern "C" void (*ARM9_CTOR_START[])(void);`. The literal `0x020eeb18` passes USA only with its
`relocs.txt` entry set to `module:none`, and fails EUR, whose table is 0x10 later (`0200edc8`).

## RELOCS — an array-indexed base needs its OWN extern symbol
`&data_02107870[i]` fails the reloc check: mwcc addend relocs resolve back to the base symbol. Each
argument needed its own extern (`data_021078a8`, `data_021078e0`) while the array-indexed STORE base
kept its `+0x38` / `+0x70` immediates (`0204a4ac`).

**A VTABLE POINTER IS AN ADDEND RELOC — give it its own symbol.** The vptr store loads
`_ZTV<Class>+8` from the pool, and as an addend it fails the same check. Add an alias in
`symbols.txt` AT that address and use it: `data_ov033_022a2a14_vptr` turned `RELOC-WRONG 1` into
MATCH (`022a2998`).

## A BLOCK REPEATED VERBATIM IN THE ROM IS A MACRO — `-inline noauto` WILL NOT INLINE IT
Under this build mwcc inlines an `inline` function only when its body is about five statements or
fewer, and never a template whose return value is a named local. Anything larger is emitted out of
line with a `bl`, and the function comes out UNDERGEN by the block size times its copies. A
repeated eight-call sequence (load overlay, allocate, ctor, stub, run, dtor, free, unload) is a
`#define … do { … } while (0)` macro. A block that appears once at the loop head and again at the
loop tail, with the tail branching back to the head, is written twice in the loop body; mwcc does
not duplicate it (`main:02000c9c`).
A step macro whose multi-term sum adds in the wrong order: bind the leaf operand and the sum to
block-scoped locals inside the macro (`{ unsigned long xv = (w); unsigned long sum = a + f(b, c, d) +
xv + *t++; a = b + ROTATE_LEFT(sum, s); }`), and give each unrolled round its own `do` counter,
declared after the word pointer (`020c04e8`).

## A DESTRUCTOR WRITTEN AS A C++ DESTRUCTOR EMITS THREE OF THEM
`Class::~Class()` makes mwcc emit the D0 (deleting), D1 (complete) and D2 (base) variants, and under
`-nodead` all three are kept — the ROM has one, so the slot OVERGENs and the whole module shifts.
Write the one the ROM has, under its mangled name, and none of the others exist (the one `extern "C"`
`_Z` form plausible.py allows is this definition of a constructor or destructor variant):

    extern "C" ARM Ov33BackgroundLoader* _ZN20Ov33BackgroundLoaderD1Ev(Ov33BackgroundLoader* self);

It returns `self`, like the real D1. `022a2998` went `OVERGEN 0x68 -> 0x20` on that line alone. The
same reasoning applies to a constructor's `[base]` duplicate.

An implicit `operator=` is the same trap (`ov026:021d8ba0`, `021dddcc`). A struct with NAMED members, declared
bare and then assigned — `Vec3i v; ... v = data;` — makes mwcc emit an out-of-line
`_ZN5Vec3iaSERKS_` and call it; `-nodead` keeps that symbol, so the file can never match however
good its byte count looks. Give the struct ONE ARRAY member (`struct Vec3i { int v[3]; };`) and the
copy inlines to the ROM's `ldr [pc] / ldm / stm`.

## DIVISION AND SMALL HELPERS
- `% 3u` (unsigned) binds `_u32_div_f`; a signed modulo binds `_s32_div_f` (`0208a5d8`). An
  `unsigned char` promoted to int gives the SIGNED helper (`02020fc4`).
- a `static inline` helper is emitted out-of-line as a `bl`. Expand it into a macro ternary —
  `(v) < 0 ? (v)%8 + 8 : (v)%8` (`02027438`).
- spell a shifted mask as `((e) << 16) & 0x1ff0000`, not `((e) & 0x1ff) << 16`, which mwcc lowers to
  `lsl#23/lsr#7` instead of the pooled AND (`02027438`).
- an inline `lsr / rsb / ror` bit-trick where you emit a `bl _s32_div_f` means your DIVISOR GUESS is
  wrong, not your expression: mwcc only open-codes a modulo by a POWER OF 2, so a ROM doing the
  trick is doing `% 4`, never `% 3` (`0215e250`, OVERGEN 8 to size-exact).
- a skip inside a `for` belongs in the loop's own increment clause, not an `if { i++; continue; }`
  body -- the clause form branches straight to the shared tail the ROM shares (`0215e250`).
- `strcpy(p, "lit")` is open-coded only when `strcpy` is declared in a header NAMED `string.h`:
  `#include <string.h>`. The same prototype in any other header or in the file stays a `bl strcpy`,
  so literal byte stores with no strcpy call in the ROM mean that include (`020026b4`, `02002cb4`).

## BITFIELDS ARE REAL MEMBERS, NOT MASKS
`(x & 0xf) == 0` emits `tst` + `bne`. The target's `ldrb / lsl#0x1c / lsrs#0x1c / bne` comes from an
actual `unsigned char mode:4` member (`02020838`). A 7:1 pair at 0x2c reads as `lsl#25/lsr#25` and
`lsl#24/lsr#31` (`021982ac`). Model the bitfield; do not mask.

This applies to a value a CALLEE hands back as much as to one you load: declaring the packed result
fields as real bitfields, copied from whichever matched sibling already declares that struct, is
what took `021dc694` on its first compile -- hand-rolled shift/mask on the same fields does not.

### A BITFIELD INSERT PUTS ITS RESULT IN THE VALUE'S REGISTER — accumulate with `|=` instead
`rec.f = Val()` emits `bic rW, rW, #mask` / `orr rV, rW, rV, lsr #k` / `str rV, [sp, #N]`: the OR
lands in the INSERTED VALUE's register, and because the store then needs it, the next statement's
setup is pushed past the store. The ROM does the opposite — it accumulates into the WORD's register
and computes the next call's argument before storing. Bind the value first, then accumulate:

    { unsigned int v = (unsigned int)Val() << 24; rec.u.raw &= ~0xff000; rec.u.raw |= v >> 12; }

    ROM / ours after:  bic r1, r1, #0xff000 ; orr r1, r1, r0, lsr #12 ; add r0, r4, #0x30 ; str r1
    ours before:       bic r1, r1, #0xff000 ; orr r0, r1, r0, lsr #12 ; str r0 ; add r0, r4, #0x30

The temp is REQUIRED: with the call inside the `|=` the word has to be reloaded after it
(`ldr` + 4 bytes). A single `W = (W & mask) | v` is a two-operand OR with no accumulator and keeps
the wrong destination. The shape is `(val << (32 - width)) >> (32 - width - offset)`, which is what
the bitfield assignment already emits. `0209a104` 33 -> 27; the corpus source that shows the
accumulator form is `GenerateDeviceRandomBytes_020120f0` (`packed = a<<24 | b<<16 | c<<8 | d`).

A dead `strb` triple (raw, `and`, `mov r0,r0`) that survives in the ROM is a 1-byte struct returned
by a `static inline` wrapper and assigned to a FUNCTION-scope struct whose address is taken
(`0201a600`). The unused pointer local that takes the address is suspect; look for a real use first.

### A BITFIELD READ INSIDE AN `add` LOSES ITS LAST SHIFT — cast it to `short`
`add rd, rn, rm, shift` folds ONE shift, and a bitfield read ends in one. Written bare, the extract
is folded into the add and the OTHER operand takes the register: `add r0, r0, r1, lsr #31` where the
target has `lsr r1, r1, #0x1f` standing on its own line and folds `i * 2` instead. A `(short)` cast
on the read blocks the fold without emitting anything -- mwcc knows the field cannot overflow a
short -- so the extract materialises and the add folds the other operand:

    (short)fld->flag + i * 2 + 0x7530      // lsl#6 / lsr#31 / add r1, r1, r6, lsl #1   MATCH
    fld->flag + i * 2 + 0x7530             // lsl#6 / add r0, r0, r1, lsr #31           21 bytes out

`ov012:0218a9ec`. `(int)`, `|0`, a named local, `(x << 6) >> 31` and `opt_propagation off` all still
fold; `(unsigned char)` and `& 1` change the extract itself and cost more.

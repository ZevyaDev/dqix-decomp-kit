# Clear the whole staged backlog with ONE build if possible, falling back to per-module only on red.
# Usage: bash integrate_fast.sh        (fleet STOPPED)
#
# WHY. The build is GLOBAL -- `ninja check` builds the whole ROM and `sha1` verifies the whole image
# regardless of which module changed -- but finish_wave is per module, so clearing ten modules cost
# ten full rebuilds to verify what one rebuild verifies. That is pure wall-clock waste when the work
# is good, which it usually is.
#
# The per-module structure is not pointless: when a build goes red from link drift, culling culprits
# is only tractable if you know which module to suspect. So this is a HYBRID, not a replacement --
# best case one build instead of ten, worst case one wasted build then the old path unchanged.

# HOLD BACK THE SECURE AREA. 0x02000000-0x02000800 stubs drift the layout CUMULATIVELY, which is why
# the project lands them one per wave. Every previous combined build included eleven of them at once
# (GetCRC16, BitUnPack, CpuFastSet, VBlankIntrWait, WaitByLoop, Div, Sqrt, SoftReset ...) and every
# one of those runs went RED with a symbol shifted by a small multiple of 4 -- 08-20 reported
# `data_020eeb18 ... is at 0x020eeb2c`, off by 0x14. The combined build was never unsound; it just
# always carried the one class of function that cannot be batched. They are moved, not dropped:
# land_harvest.sh feeds them back one per wave.
# INTEGRATE EXACTLY WHAT WE STAGED, NOTHING ELSE. integrate.py takes its candidates from every
# UNTRACKED file under src/ (integrate.py:165), so src/ doubles as the working tree AND the handoff
# channel: anything left lying there -- a killed wave's placement, a NOSKIP run, a crashed job --
# joins the combined build uninvited. That is how 0208f588, skiplisted for reding ARM9 main's
# checksum, got wired into a build nobody chose to put it in. Sweep src/ clean first; the files are
# moved, not deleted, and waves re-gather them from hold_<mod>/.

# first; it is preserved, not deleted, and the per-module path can still try it later.

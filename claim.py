"""Atomically hand out ONE unmatched address to a worker. The pull half of pull-based dispatch.

    python claim.py <main|NNN>            claim the next address, print it (empty = pool drained;
                                          exit 3 = the kit is behind, run kit_update.py first)
    python claim.py <mod> --release <ad>  put one back (worker died without a verdict)
    python claim.py <mod> --status        how many are claimed right now

WHY PULL INSTEAD OF PRE-PARTITION. genwave hands each worker a fixed batch of P addresses. The
batches are never equally hard, so a worker that draws three easy functions finishes and idles while
another grinds three hard ones -- and the pre-partition is decided before anyone knows which is
which. Pulling one at a time balances by construction and deletes the SMALL_PER tuning question.

WHY ONE AT A TIME, NOT "PULL UNTIL THE BUDGET RUNS OUT". Cost per message rises with session length:
measured over 264 worker sessions, $0.0623/msg at 10-39 messages against $0.1777/msg past 220. A
worker that keeps pulling builds one long session and pays the expensive rate for its later
functions. One function per session keeps every session in the cheap band; `--max-budget-usd` is
then a backstop against a single runaway, not the stopping rule.

The claim is a directory created with mkdir, which is atomic on every filesystem we run on -- an
O_EXCL file would do as well, but a directory also survives being inspected by hand. A stale claim
(worker killed) is reclaimed after CLAIM_TTL_MIN so addresses cannot leak out of the pool forever.

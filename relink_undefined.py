"""Repair the link after merging a human branch, in both directions.

A merge with the human decomp leaves two symmetric breakages:

  1. OUR callers name a function the human branch folded into a class
     (CallFunc0202fa38ZeroPad is now BackgroundLoader::QueueLoadFile).
  2. THEIR files name a function we have since decompiled and renamed
     (func_0200fb08 is now NormalizeField5_0200fb08(Struct0200fb08*)).

Both are one lookup: take the address, ask the merged symbols.txt what lives
there now, rewrite the caller. Nothing is guessed -- an address or current symbol
that cannot be resolved is reported and left alone.

Two things this has to get right, both learned the hard way:

  * A caller may spell the callee with its MANGLED name
    (_Z21CallFunc0202fa38Mode2iiii), the bridge this repo uses when the caller
    has no access to the callee's argument types. A word-boundary search for the
    plain name never matches inside the mangled form, so those call sites were
    silently skipped and the link kept failing on the same symbol every round.
  * Renaming a free function to its mangled name only links if the declaration
    is extern "C". Left as a plain C++ declaration the compiler mangles the
    already-mangled name a second time, and the error returns wearing the new
    name: Undefined: _Z11UnlockMutexP5Mutex(RefNode020c80f8*).

Member calls become ((Class*)(arg0))->Method(rest); the casts are deliberate, so
the register setup is unchanged and a file that matched before still matches.

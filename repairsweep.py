"""Re-gate every parked candidate on the project compiler, repairing the two
faults that park correct work.

Most parked sources are not wrong codegen. They fail for mechanical reasons the
tools now know how to fix:

  * UNDEF-SYM -- a callee declared under a name that was never committed.
    fixundef.py resolves it from the address and re-gates.
  * `.init total=0x0` -- a function that lives in .init compiled without
    `#pragma define_section initcode`, so it emits no code in the right section.

For each candidate: try wgate as-is, then apply whichever repair the verdict
calls for, and report what ends up MATCHing. Writes a report the caller can act
on; makes no change to the repository.

"""Regenerate STATE.md — the single machine-written answer to "where are we?".

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every session was hand-editing the `dqix-plan` and `dqix-continue` skills to keep a
"State as of <date>" block current: coverage, knobs, what landed, what is broken. That defeats the
point of a skill (a stable procedure) and it goes stale the moment a wave commits. The skills now
carry PROCEDURE ONLY and point here; this file carries the facts and nothing hand-written.

Costs no model tokens. `pull_all.sh` refreshes it every loop, and it is safe to run by hand:

    python progress.py          # rewrite STATE.md
    python progress.py --print  # and echo it

Hand-written knowledge -- cracked idioms, open residues, what has been ruled out -- stays in
OPEN_WORK.md, which this file links to rather than duplicates.

# dqix-decomp-kit

Tools for matching Dragon Quest IX (Nintendo DS, USA) functions to byte-exact C++ in
[ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp](https://github.com/ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp), branch `decomp-matching`. Usable by
hand, from a single AI session, or as an autonomous fleet of Claude Code workers.

The kit compiles a candidate with the build's own `mwccarm` and flags, compares it against the
original ROM bytes, names the class of whatever still differs, applies meaning-preserving rewrites,
and lands matches through one serialized, gated path that commits to the decomp.

## Platform

Tested on Windows 11, Git Bash, Python 3.10. The per-function tools are plain Python but run the
decomp's `mwccarm.exe` directly; untested on any other system. The fleet scripts list processes with
PowerShell `Get-CimInstance` and run only on Windows.

## Quickstart

Clone both repositories side by side. The kit finds the decomp at `../dqix-decomp`, or at
`$DQIX_REPO`.

    git clone -b decomp-matching https://github.com/<you>/dqix-decomp.git   # your fork of ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp
    git clone https://github.com/ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp-kit.git

Build the decomp once. Supply your own base ROM and place it as the decomp README says
(`extract/baserom_dqix_usa.nds`).

    cd dqix-decomp
    python -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt ninja
    python tools/configure.py usa
    ninja min

Initialise the kit:

    cd ../dqix-decomp-kit
    python -m pip install capstone pyelftools
    python kit_init.py --slow
    python selfcheck.py

`--slow` runs the end-to-end crack tests once; `selfcheck.py` fails until they have run.

The kit is updated continuously. Start every session with `python kit_update.py`; agents are told to
in `AGENTS.md`.

The checkout holds code only. Your attempts, logs, claims and staged matches live in a separate
state directory, `../dqix-kit-state` by default (`python kit_init.py --state <dir>` to put it
elsewhere), so no git command run in the checkout can touch them.

Match one function. Module is `main` or a 3-digit overlay; addresses are 8 hex digits without `0x`.

    export KIT="$(pwd -W 2>/dev/null || pwd)" SP="$(python kitpaths.py state)"
    python claim.py 017 --peek 5                    # next candidates in overlay 017; claims nothing
    A=021bb1a4                                      # one of them
    F="$SP/wip/ov017/$A.cpp"; mkdir -p "$SP/wip/ov017" "$SP/staging/ov017"
    python scaffold.py 017 $A "$F"                  # callees and data resolved, a stub to fill in
    python wlist.py 017 $A                          # the target, decoded from the ROM
    python wgate.py 017 $A "$F"                     # MATCH, or RESIDUE <CLASS> <metric> <detail>
    python wdiff.py 017 $A "$F"                     # only the differing instructions
    python colorsweep.py 017 $A "$F" --apply        # mechanical rewrites, stops on MATCH
    cp "$F" "$SP/staging/ov017/$A.cpp"
    bash finish_wave.sh 017                         # integrate, ninja check, commit, push

`wgate.py` and `wdiff.py` change into the decomp directory, so source paths must be absolute.
`finish_wave.sh` reverts uncommitted edits to tracked files under the decomp's `include/`, `config/`
and `src/` before it starts; commit your own changes first. [docs/WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORKFLOW.md)
explains every step.

`kit_init.py` creates, under the state directory, `wip/`, `staging/`, `handwork/`, `wlog/`, `gated/`,
`clsbest/`, `claims/`, `scaffold/`, `doc_cache/`, `attempts/`, `quarantine/`, `refs/`.

## AI agents

Run the agent with the kit root as its working directory; there is nothing to install beyond the
quickstart. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the instructions and hard rules every agent reads.

| agent | loads |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` (imports `AGENTS.md`), skills in `.claude/skills/`, the `dqix-crack` and `dqix-evolve` workflows in `.claude/workflows/` |
| Codex and other Agent Skills readers | `AGENTS.md`, and `dqix-hand-match`, `dqix-status`, `dqix-stop`, `dqix-coordinate` from `.agents/skills/`, which `kit_init.py` fills |
| any other agent | `AGENTS.md`; the per-function flow in `docs/WORKFLOW.md` needs nothing but a shell |

`dqix-plan`, `dqix-continue`, the workflows and the fleet use Claude Code features and stay Claude
Code only. Edit skills in `.claude/skills/`; `.agents/skills/` is a generated copy.
